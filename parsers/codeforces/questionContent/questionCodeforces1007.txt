There are
n
equidistant antennas on a line, numbered from
1
to
n
. Each antenna has a power rating, the power of the
i
-th antenna is
p
i
.
The
i
-th and the
j
-th antenna can communicate directly if and only if their distance is at most the minimum of their powers, i.e.,
|i−j|≤min(
p
i
,
p
j
)
. Sending a message directly between two such antennas takes
1
second.
What is the minimum amount of time necessary to send a message from antenna
a
to antenna
b
, possibly using other antennas as relays?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤100000
) — the number of test cases. The descriptions of the
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
a
,
b
(
1≤a,b≤n≤200000
) — the number of antennas, and the origin and target antenna.
The second line contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — the powers of the antennas.
The sum of the values of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
200000
.
Output
For each test case, print the number of seconds needed to trasmit a message from
a
to
b
. It can be shown that under the problem constraints, it is always possible to send such a message.

Note
In the first test case, we must send a message from antenna
2
to antenna
9
. A sequence of communications requiring
4
seconds, which is the minimum possible amount of time, is the following:
In
1
second we send the message from antenna
2
to antenna
1
. This is possible since
|2−1|≤min(1,4)=min(
p
2
,
p
1
)
.
In
1
second we send the message from antenna
1
to antenna
5
. This is possible since
|1−5|≤min(4,5)=min(
p
1
,
p
5
)
.
In
1
second we send the message from antenna
5
to antenna
10
. This is possible since
|5−10|≤min(5,5)=min(
p
5
,
p
10
)
.
In
1
second we send the message from antenna
10
to antenna
9
. This is possible since
|10−9|≤min(5,1)=min(
p
10
,
p
9
)
.
