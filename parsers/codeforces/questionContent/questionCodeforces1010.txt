The map of Europe can be represented by a set of
n
cities, numbered from
1
through
n
, which are connected by
m
bidirectional roads, each of which connects two distinct cities. A trip of length
k
is a sequence of
k+1
cities
v
1
,
v
2
,…,
v
k+1
such that there is a road connecting each consecutive pair
v
i
,
v
i+1
of cities, for all
1≤i≤k
. A special trip is a trip that does not use the same road twice in a row, i.e., a sequence of
k+1
cities
v
1
,
v
2
,…,
v
k+1
such that it forms a trip and
v
i
≠
v
i+2
, for all
1≤i≤k−1
.
Given an integer
k
, compute the number of distinct special trips of length
k
which begin and end in the same city. Since the answer might be large, give the answer modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
and
k
(
3≤n≤100
,
1≤m≤n(n−1)/2
,
1≤k≤
10
4
) — the number of cities, the number of roads and the length of trips to consider.
Each of the following
m
lines contains a pair of distinct integers
a
and
b
(
1≤a,b≤n
) — each pair represents a road connecting cities
a
and
b
. It is guaranteed that the roads are distinct (i.e., each pair of cities is connected by at most one road).
Output
Print the number of special trips of length
k
which begin and end in the same city, modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first sample, we are looking for special trips of length
2
, but since we cannot use the same road twice once we step away from a city we cannot go back, so the answer is
0
.
In the second sample, we have the following
12
special trips of length
3
which begin and end in the same city:
(1,2,4,1)
,
(1,3,4,1)
,
(1,4,2,1)
,
(1,4,3,1)
,
(2,1,4,2)

(2,4,1,2)
,
(3,1,4,3)
,
(3,4,1,3)
,
(4,1,3,4)
,
(4,3,1,4)
,
(4,1,2,4)
, and
(4,2,1,4)
