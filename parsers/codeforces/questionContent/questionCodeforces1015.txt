You are given two arrays: an array
a
consisting of
n
zeros and an array
b
consisting of
n
integers.
You can apply the following operation to the array
a
an arbitrary number of times: choose some subsegment of
a
of length
k
and add the arithmetic progression
1,2,…,k
to this subsegment — i. e. add
1
to the first element of the subsegment,
2
to the second element, and so on. The chosen subsegment should be inside the borders of the array
a
(i.e., if the left border of the chosen subsegment is
l
, then the condition
1≤l≤l+k−1≤n
should be satisfied). Note that the progression added is always
1,2,…,k
but not the
k,k−1,…,1
or anything else (i.e., the leftmost element of the subsegment always increases by
1
, the second element always increases by
2
and so on).
Your task is to find the minimum possible number of operations required to satisfy the condition
a
i
≥
b
i
for each
i
from
1
to
n
. Note that the condition
a
i
≥
b
i
should be satisfied for all elements at once.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤3⋅
10
5
) — the number of elements in both arrays and the length of the subsegment, respectively.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤
10
12
), where
b
i
is the
i
-th element of the array
b
.
Output
Print one integer — the minimum possible number of operations required to satisfy the condition
a
i
≥
b
i
for each
i
from
1
to
n
.

Note
Consider the first example. In this test, we don't really have any choice, so we need to add at least five progressions to make the first element equals
5
. The array
a
becomes
[5,10,15]
.
Consider the second example. In this test, let's add one progression on the segment
[1;3]
and two progressions on the segment
[4;6]
. Then, the array
a
becomes
[1,2,3,2,4,6]
.
