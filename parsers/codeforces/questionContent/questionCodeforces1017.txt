Suppose you have an integer
v
. In one operation, you can:
either set
v=(v+1)mod32768
or set
v=(2⋅v)mod32768
.
You are given
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. What is the minimum number of operations you need to make each
a
i
equal to
0
?
Input
The first line contains the single integer
n
(
1≤n≤32768
) — the number of integers.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
<32768
).
Output
Print
n
integers. The
i
-th integer should be equal to the minimum number of operations required to make
a
i
equal to
0
.

Note
Let's consider each
a
i
:
a
1
=19
. You can, firstly, increase it by one to get
20
and then multiply it by two
13
times. You'll get
0
in
1+13=14
steps.
a
2
=32764
. You can increase it by one
4
times:
32764→32765→32766→32767→0
.
a
3
=10240
. You can multiply it by two
4
times:
10240→20480→8192→16384→0
.
a
4
=49
. You can multiply it by two
15
times.
