The cuteness of a binary string is the number of
1
s divided by the length of the string. For example, the cuteness of
01101
is
3
5
.
Juju has a binary string
s
of length
n
. She wants to choose some non-intersecting subsegments of
s
such that their concatenation has length
m
and it has the same cuteness as the string
s
.
More specifically, she wants to find two arrays
l
and
r
of equal length
k
such that
1≤
l
1
≤
r
1
<
l
2
≤
r
2
<…<
l
k
≤
r
k
≤n
, and also:
∑
i=1
k
(
r
i
−
l
i
+1)=m
;
The cuteness of
s[
l
1
,
r
1
]+s[
l
2
,
r
2
]+…+s[
l
k
,
r
k
]
is equal to the cuteness of
s
, where
s[x,y]
denotes the subsegment
s
x
s
x+1
…
s
y
, and
+
denotes string concatenation.
Juju does not like splitting the string into many parts, so she also wants to minimize the value of
k
. Find the minimum value of
k
such that there exist
l
and
r
that satisfy the constraints above or determine that it is impossible to find such
l
and
r
for any
k
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤m≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains a binary string
s
of length
n
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, if there is no valid pair of
l
and
r
, print
−1
.
Otherwise, print
k+1
lines.
In the first line, print a number
k
(
1≤k≤m
) — the minimum number of subsegments required.
Then print
k
lines, the
i
-th should contain
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
) — the range of the
i
-th subsegment. Note that you should output the subsegments such that the inequality
l
1
≤
r
1
<
l
2
≤
r
2
<…<
l
k
≤
r
k
is true.

Note
In the first example, the cuteness of
0011
is the same as the cuteness of
01
.
In the second example, the cuteness of
11000011
is
1
2
and there is no subsegment of size
6
with the same cuteness. So we must use
2
disjoint subsegments
10
and
0011
.
In the third example, there are
8
ways to split the string such that
∑
i=1
k
(
r
i
−
l
i
+1)=3
but none of them has the same cuteness as
0101
.
In the last example, we don't have to split the string.
