Marin wants you to count number of permutations that are beautiful. A beautiful permutation of length
n
is a permutation that has the following property:
gcd(1⋅
p
1
,2⋅
p
2
,…,n⋅
p
n
)>1,
gcd
(
1
2
)
1
where
gcd
is the greatest common divisor.
A permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
3
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
3
).
Output
For each test case, print one integer — number of beautiful permutations. Because the answer can be very big, please print the answer modulo
998244353
.

Note
In first test case, we only have one permutation which is
[1]
but it is not beautiful because
gcd(1⋅1)=1
.
In second test case, we only have one beautiful permutation which is
[2,1]
because
gcd(1⋅2,2⋅1)=2
.
