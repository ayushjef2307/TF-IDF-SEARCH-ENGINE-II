You are given a tree consisting of
n
vertices, and
q
triples
(
x
i
,
y
i
,
s
i
)
, where
x
i
and
y
i
are integers from
1
to
n
, and
s
i
is a string with length equal to the number of vertices on the simple path from
x
i
to
y
i
.
You want to write a lowercase Latin letter on each vertex in such a way that, for each of
q
given triples, at least one of the following conditions holds:
if you write out the letters on the vertices on the simple path from
x
i
to
y
i
in the order they appear on this path, you get the string
s
i
;
if you write out the letters on the vertices on the simple path from
y
i
to
x
i
in the order they appear on this path, you get the string
s
i
.
Find any possible way to write a letter on each vertex to meet these constraints, or report that it is impossible.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n≤4⋅
10
5
;
1≤q≤4⋅
10
5
) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of triples, respectively.
Then
n−1
lines follow; the
i
-th of them contains two integers
u
i
and
v
i
(
1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n
;
u
i
≠
v
i
) — the endpoints of the
i
-th edge. These edges form a tree.
Then
q
lines follow; the
j
-th of them contains two integers
x
j
and
y
j
, and a string
s
j
consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of
s
j
is equal to the number of vertices on the simple path between
x
j
and
y
j
.
Additional constraint on the input:
∑
j=1
q
|
s
j
|≤4⋅

.
Output
If there is no way to meet the conditions on all triples, print NO. Otherwise, print YES in the first line, and a string of
n
lowercase Latin letters in the second line; the
i
-th character of the string should be the letter you write on the
i
-th vertex. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
