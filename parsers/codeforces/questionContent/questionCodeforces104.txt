In Japan, the number
4
reads like death, so Bob decided to build a live sequence. Living sequence
a
contains all natural numbers that do not contain the digit
4
.
a=[1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,15,16,…]
.
For example, the number
1235
is part of the sequence
a
, but the numbers
4321
,
443
are not part of the sequence
a
.
Bob realized that he does not know how to quickly search for a particular number by the position
k
in the sequence, so he asks for your help.
For example, if Bob wants to find the number at position
k=4
(indexing from
1
), you need to answer
a
k
=5
.
Input
The first line of input data contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
In the only line of each test case, there is a single integer
k
(
1≤k≤
10
12
) — the position Bob is interested in.
Output
For each test case, print on a separate line the number
a
k
in indexing with
1
.
