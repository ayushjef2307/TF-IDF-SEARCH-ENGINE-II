In this problem, we will consider complete undirected graphs consisting of
n
vertices with weighted edges. The weight of each edge is an integer from
1
to
k
.
An undirected graph is considered beautiful if the sum of weights of all edges incident to vertex
1
is equal to the weight of MST in the graph. MST is the minimum spanning tree — a tree consisting of
n−1
edges of the graph, which connects all
n
vertices and has the minimum sum of weights among all such trees; the weight of MST is the sum of weights of all edges in it.
Calculate the number of complete beautiful graphs having exactly
n
vertices and the weights of edges from
1
to
k
. Since the answer might be large, print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The only line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤250
;
1≤k≤250
).
Output
Print one integer — the number of complete beautiful graphs having exactly
n
vertices and the weights of edges from
1
to
k
. Since the answer might be large, print it modulo
998244353
.
