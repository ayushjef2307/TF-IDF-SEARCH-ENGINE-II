You are given four integers
n
,
B
,
x
and
y
. You should build a sequence
a
0
,
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
where
a
0
=0
and for each
i≥1
you can choose:
either
a
i
=
a
i−1
+x
or
a
i
=
a
i−1
−y
.
Your goal is to build such a sequence
a
that
a
i
≤B
for all
i
and
∑
i=0
n
a
i
is maximum possible.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Next
t
cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains four integers
n
,
B
,
x
and
y
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;
1≤B,x,y≤
10
9
).
It's guaranteed that the total sum of
n
doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum possible
∑
i=0
n
a
i
.

In the first test case, the optimal sequence
a
is
