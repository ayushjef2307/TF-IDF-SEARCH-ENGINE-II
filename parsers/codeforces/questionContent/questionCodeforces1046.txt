You are given two sets of positive integers
A
and
B
. You have to find two non-empty subsets
S
A
⊆A
,
S
B
⊆B
so that the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements of
S
A
is equal to the least common multiple (LCM) of the elements of
S
B
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤200
), the number of test cases.
For each test case, there is one line containing two integers
n,m
(
1≤n,m≤1000
), the sizes of the sets
A
and
B
, respectively.
The next line contains
n
distinct integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤

i

), the elements of
A
.
The next line contains
m
distinct integers
b
1
,
b
2

b
m
(
1≤
b
i
≤4⋅
10
36
), the elements of
B
.
The sum of
n
for all test cases and the sum of
m
for all test cases is at most
1000
.
Output
For each test case, if there do not exist two subsets with equal least common multiple, output one line with NO.
Otherwise, output one line with YES, followed by a line with two integers
