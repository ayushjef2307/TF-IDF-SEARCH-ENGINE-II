You are given
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. For any real number
t
, consider the complete weighted graph on
n
vertices
K
n
(t)
with weight of the edge between vertices
i
and
j
equal to
w
ij
(t)=
a
i
⋅
a
j
+t⋅(
a
i
+
a
j
)
.
Let
f(t)
be the cost of the minimum spanning tree of
K
n
(t)
. Determine whether
f(t)
is bounded above and, if so, output the maximum value it attains.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
T
(
1≤T≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of vertices of the graph.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−
10
6
≤
a
i
≤

).
The sum of
n
for all test cases is at most
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line with the maximum value of
f(t)
(it can be shown that it is an integer), or INF if
f(t)
is not bounded above.
