We say that a positive integer
n
is
k
-good for some positive integer
k
if
n
can be expressed as a sum of
k
positive integers which give
k
distinct remainders when divided by
k
.
Given a positive integer
n
, find some
k≥2
so that
n
is
k
-good or tell that such a
k
does not exist.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line with an integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
18
).
Output
For each test case, print a line with a value of
k
such that
n
is
k
-good (
k≥2
), or
−1
if
n
is not
k
-good for any
k
. If there are multiple valid values of
k
, you can print any of them.

Note
6
is a
3
-good number since it can be expressed as a sum of
3
numbers which give different remainders when divided by
3
:
6=1+2+3
.
15
is also a
3
-good number since
15=1+5+9
and
1,5,9
give different remainders when divided by
3
.
20
is a
5
-good number since
20=2+3+4+5+6
and
2,3,4,5,6
give different remainders when divided by
5
.
