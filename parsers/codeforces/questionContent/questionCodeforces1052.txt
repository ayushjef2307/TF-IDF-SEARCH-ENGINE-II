You are given a list of
n
integers. You can perform the following operation: you choose an element
x
from the list, erase
x
from the list, and subtract the value of
x
from all the remaining elements. Thus, in one operation, the length of the list is decreased by exactly
1
.
Given an integer
k
(
k>0
), find if there is some sequence of
n−1
operations such that, after applying the operations, the only remaining element of the list is equal to
k
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤k≤
10
9
), the number of integers in the list, and the target value, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains the
n
integers of the list
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases is not greater that
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print YES if you can achieve
k
with a sequence of
n−1
operations. Otherwise, print NO.
You may print each letter in any case (for example, "YES", "Yes", "yes", "yEs" will all be recognized as a positive answer).

Note
In the first example we have the list
{4,2,2,7}
, and we have the target
k=5
. One way to achieve it is the following: first we choose the third element, obtaining the list
{2,0,5}
. Next we choose the first element, obtaining the list
{−2,3}
. Finally, we choose the first element, obtaining the list
{5}
.
