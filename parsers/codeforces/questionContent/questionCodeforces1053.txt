You are given an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of positive integers. A good pair is a pair of indices
(i,j)
with
1≤i,j≤n
such that, for all
1≤k≤n
, the following equality holds:
|
a
i
−
a
k
|+|

a
i

a
j
|,
|
|
|
|
|
|
where
|x|
denotes the absolute value of
x
.
Find a good pair. Note that
i
can be equal to
j
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) where
a
i
is the
i
-th element of the array.
The sum of
n
for all test cases is at most
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line with two space-separated indices
i
and
j
which form a good pair of the array. The case
i=j
is allowed. It can be shown that such a pair always exists. If there are multiple good pairs, print any of them.
