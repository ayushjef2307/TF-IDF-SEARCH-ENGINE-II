You are given an integer
n
and a string
s
consisting of
2
n
lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The characters of the string
s
are
s
0
s
1
s
2
⋯
s
2
n
−1
.
A string
t
of length
2
n
(whose characters are denoted by
t
0
t
1
t
2
⋯
t
2
n
−1
) is a xoration of
s
if there exists an integer
j
(
0≤j≤
2
n
−1
) such that, for each
0≤i≤
2
n
−1
,
t
i
=
s
i⊕j
(where
⊕
denotes the operation bitwise XOR).
Find the lexicographically minimal xoration of
s
.
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
if and only if one of the following holds:
a
is a prefix of
b
, but
a≠b
;
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤18
).
The second line contains a string
s
consisting of
2
n
lowercase letters of the English alphabet.
Output
Print a single line containing the lexicographically minimal xoration of
s
.

Note
In the first test, the lexicographically minimal xoration
t
of
s=
"acba" is "abca". It's a xoration because, for
j=3
,
t
0
=
s
0⊕j
=
s
3
=
"a";
t
1
=
s
1⊕j
=
s
2
=
"b";
t
2
=
s
2⊕j
=
s
1
=
"c";
t
3
=
s
3⊕j
=
s
0
=
"a".
There isn't any xoration of
s
lexicographically smaller than "abca".
In the second test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing
j=4
in the definition of xoration.
In the third test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing
j=11
in the definition of xoration.
In the fourth test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing
j=10
in the definition of xoration.
In the fifth test, the minimal string xoration corresponds to choosing either
j=0
or
j=1
in the definition of xoration.
