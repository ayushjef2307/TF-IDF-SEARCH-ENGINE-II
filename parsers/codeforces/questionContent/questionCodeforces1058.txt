Alice's potion making professor gave the following assignment to his students: brew a potion using
n
ingredients, such that the proportion of ingredient
i
in the final potion is
r
i
>0
(and
r
1
+
r
2
+⋯+
r
n
=1
).
He forgot the recipe, and now all he remembers is a set of
n−1
facts of the form, "ingredients
i
and
j
should have a ratio of
x
to
y
" (i.e., if
a
i
and
a
j
are the amounts of ingredient
i
and
j
in the potion respectively, then it must hold
a
i
/
a
j
=x/y
), where
x
and
y
are positive integers. However, it is guaranteed that the set of facts he remembers is sufficient to uniquely determine the original values
r
i
.
He decided that he will allow the students to pass the class as long as they submit a potion which satisfies all of the
n−1
requirements (there may be many such satisfactory potions), and contains a positive integer amount of each ingredient.
Find the minimum total amount of ingredients needed to make a potion which passes the class. As the result can be very large, you should print the answer modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
Each of the next
n−1
lines contains four integers
i,j,x,y
(
1≤i,j≤n
,
i≠j
,
1≤x,y≤n
) — ingredients
i
and
j
should have a ratio of
x
to
y
. It is guaranteed that the set of facts is sufficient to uniquely determine the original values
r
i
.
It is also guaranteed that the sum of
n
for all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print the minimum total amount of ingredients needed to make a potion which passes the class, modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case, the minimum total amount of ingredients is
69
. In fact, the amounts of ingredients
1,2,3,4
of a valid potion are
16,12,9,32
, respectively. The potion is valid because
Ingredients
3
and
2
have a ratio of
9:12=3:4
;
Ingredients
1
and
2
have a ratio of
16:12=4:3
;
Ingredients
1
and
4
have a ratio of
16:32=2:4
.
In the second test case, the amounts of ingredients
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8
in the potion that minimizes the total amount of ingredients are
60,60,24,48,32,60,45,30
.
