Kristina had an array
a
of length
n
consisting of non-negative integers.
She built a new array
b
of length
n−1
, such that
b
i
=max(
a
i
,
a
i+1
)
(
1≤i≤n−1
).
For example, suppose Kristina had an array
a
= [
3,0,4,0,5
] of length
5
. Then she did the following:
Calculated
b
1
=max(
a
1
,
a
2
)=max(3,0)=3
;
Calculated
b
2
=max(
a
2
,
a
3
)=max(0,4)=4
;
Calculated
b
3
=max(
a
3
,
a
4
)=max(4,0)=4
;
Calculated
b
4
=max(
a
4
,
a
5
)=max(0,5)=5
.
As a result, she got an array
b
= [
3,4,4,5
] of length
4
.
You only know the array
b
. Find any matching array
a
that Kristina may have originally had.
Input
The first line of input data contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of elements in the array
a
that Kristina originally had.
The second line of each test case contains exactly
n−1
non-negative integer — elements of array
b
(
0≤
b
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
, and that array
b
was built correctly from some array
a
.
Output
For each test case on a separate line, print exactly
n
non-negative integers — the elements of the array
a
that Kristina originally had.
If there are several possible answers — output any of them.

Note
The first test case is explained in the problem statement.
In the second test case, we can get array
b
= [
2,2,1
] from the array
a
= [
2,2,1,1
]:
b
1
=max(
a
1
,
a
2
)=max(2,2)=2
;
b
2
=max(
a
2
,
a
3
)=max(2,1)=2
;
b
3
=max(
a
3
,
a
4
)=max(1,1)=1
.
In the third test case, all elements of the array
b
are zeros. Since each
b
i
is the maximum of two adjacent elements of array
a
, array
a
can only consist entirely of zeros.
In the fourth test case, we can get array
b
= [
0,3,4,4,3
] from the array
a
= [
0,0,3,4,3,3
] :
b
1
=max(
a
1
,
a
2
)=max(0,0)=0
;
b
2
=max(
a
2
,
a
3
)=max(0,3)=3
;
b
3
=max(
a
3
,
a
4
)=max(3,4)=4
;
b
4
=max(
a
4
,
a
5
)=max(4,3)=4
;
b

=max(
a
5
,
a

)=max(3,3)=3
.
