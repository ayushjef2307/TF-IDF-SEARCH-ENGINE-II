Let's denote the size of the maximum matching in a graph
G
as
MM(G)
.
You are given a bipartite graph. The vertices of the first part are numbered from
1
to
n
, the vertices of the second part are numbered from
n+1
to
2n
. Each vertex's degree is
2
.
For a tuple of four integers
(l,r,L,R)
, where
1≤l≤r≤n
and
n+1≤L≤R≤2n
, let's define
G
′
(l,r,L,R)
as the graph which consists of all vertices of the given graph that are included in the segment
[l,r]
or in the segment
[L,R]
, and all edges of the given graph such that each of their endpoints belongs to one of these segments. In other words, to obtain
G
′
(l,r,L,R)
from the original graph, you have to remove all vertices
i
such that
i∉[l,r]
and
i∉[L,R]
, and all edges incident to these vertices.
Calculate the sum of
MM(G(l,r,L,R))
over all tuples of integers
(l,r,L,R)
having
1≤l≤r≤n
and
n+1≤L≤R≤2n
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤1500
) — the number of vertices in each part.
Then
2n
lines follow, each denoting an edge of the graph. The
i
-th line contains two integers
x
i
and
y
i
(
1≤
x
i
≤n
;
n+1≤
y
i
≤2n
) — the endpoints of the
i
-th edge.
There are no multiple edges in the given graph, and each vertex has exactly two incident edges.
Output
Print one integer — the sum of
MM(G(l,r,L,R))
over all tuples of integers
(l,r,L,R)
having
1≤l≤r≤n
and
n+1≤L≤R≤2n
.
