Given an undirected connected graph with
n
vertices and
m
edges. The graph contains no loops (edges from a vertex to itself) and multiple edges (i.e. no more than one edge between each pair of vertices). The vertices of the graph are numbered from
1
to
n
.
Find the number of paths from a vertex
s
to
t
whose length differs from the shortest path from
s
to
t
by no more than
1
. It is necessary to consider all suitable paths, even if they pass through the same vertex or edge more than once (i.e. they are not simple).
Graph consisting of
6
of vertices and
8
of edges
For example, let
n=6
,
m=8
,
s=6
and
t=1
, and let the graph look like the figure above. Then the length of the shortest path from
s
to
t
is
1
. Consider all paths whose length is at most
1+1=2
.
6→1
. The length of the path is
1
.
6→4→1
. Path length is
2
.
6→2→1
. Path length is
2
.
6→5→1
. Path length is
2
.
There is a total of
4
of matching paths.
Input
The first line of test contains the number
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) —the number of test cases in the test.
Before each test case, there is a blank line.
The first line of test case contains two numbers
n,m
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤m≤2⋅
10
5
) —the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
The second line contains two numbers
s
and
t
(
1≤s,t≤n
,
s≠t
) —the numbers of the start and end vertices of the path.
The following
m
lines contain descriptions of edges: the
i
th line contains two integers
u
i
,
v
i
(
1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n
) — the numbers of vertices that connect the
i
th edge. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and does not contain loops and multiple edges.
It is guaranteed that the sum of values
n
on all test cases of input data does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
. Similarly, it is guaranteed that the sum of values
m
on all test cases of input data does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single number — the number of paths from
s
to
t
such that their length differs from the length of the shortest path by no more than
1
.
Since this number may be too large, output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
