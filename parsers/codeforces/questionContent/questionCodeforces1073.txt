Not so long ago, Vlad came up with an interesting function:
f
a
(x)=⌊
x
a
⌋+xmoda
, where
⌊
x
a
⌋
is
x
a
, rounded down,
xmoda
— the remainder of the integer division of
x
by
a
.
For example, with
a=3
and
x=11
, the value
f
3
(11)=⌊
11
3
⌋+11mod3=3+2=5
.
The number
a
is fixed and known to Vlad. Help Vlad find the maximum value of
f
a
(x)
if
x
can take any integer value from
l
to
r
inclusive (
l≤x≤r
).
Input
The first line of input data contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of input test cases.
This is followed by
t
lines, each of which contains three integers
l
i
,
r
i
and
a
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤
10
9
,1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the left and right boundaries of the segment and the fixed value of
a
.
Output
For each test case, output one number on a separate line — the maximum value of the function on a given segment for a given
a
.

Note
In the first sample:
f
3
(1)=⌊
1
3
⌋+1mod3=0+1=1
,
f
3
(2)=⌊
2
3
⌋+2mod3=0+2=2
,
f
3
(3)=⌊
3
3
⌋+3mod3=1+0=1
,
f
3
(4)=⌊
4
3
⌋+4mod3=1+1=2
As an answer, obviously,
f
3
(2)
and
f
3
(4)
are suitable.
