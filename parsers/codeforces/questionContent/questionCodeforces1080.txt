While looking at the kitchen fridge, the little boy Tyler noticed magnets with symbols, that can be aligned into a string
s
.
Tyler likes strings, and especially those that are lexicographically smaller than another string,
t
. After playing with magnets on the fridge, he is wondering, how many distinct strings can be composed out of letters of string
s
by rearranging them, so that the resulting string is lexicographically smaller than the string
t
? Tyler is too young, so he can't answer this question. The alphabet Tyler uses is very large, so for your convenience he has already replaced the same letters in
s
and
t
to the same integers, keeping that different letters have been replaced to different integers.
We call a string
x
lexicographically smaller than a string
y
if one of the followings conditions is fulfilled:
There exists such position of symbol
m
that is presented in both strings, so that before
m
-th symbol the strings are equal, and the
m
-th symbol of string
x
is smaller than
m
-th symbol of string
y
.
String
x
is the prefix of string
y
and
x≠y
.
Because the answer can be too large, print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤200000
) — the lengths of strings
s
and
t
respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
s
1
,
s
2
,
s
3
,…,
s
n
(
1≤
s
i
≤200000
) — letters of the string
s
.
The third line contains
m
integers
t
1
,
t
2
,
t
3
,…,
t
m
(
1≤
t
i
≤200000
) — letters of the string
t
.
Output
Print a single number — the number of strings lexicographically smaller than
t
that can be obtained by rearranging the letters in
s
, modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first example, the strings we are interested in are
[122]
and
[212]
. The string
[221]
is lexicographically larger than the string
[2121]
, so we don't count it.
In the second example, all strings count except
[4321]
, so the answer is
4!−1=23
.
In the third example, only the string
[1112]
counts.
