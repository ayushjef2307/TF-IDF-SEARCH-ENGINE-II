Madoka finally found the administrator password for her computer. Her father is a well-known popularizer of mathematics, so the password is the answer to the following problem.
Find the maximum decimal number without zeroes and with no equal digits in a row, such that the sum of its digits is
n
.
Madoka is too tired of math to solve it herself, so help her to solve this problem!
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤1000
) — the required sum of the digits.
Output
For each test case print the maximum number you can obtain.

Note
The only numbers with the sum of digits equal to
2
without zeros are
2
and
11
. But the last one has two ones in a row, so it's not valid. That's why the answer is
2
.
The only numbers with the sum of digits equal to
3
without zeros are
111
,
12
,
21
, and
3
. The first one has
2
ones in a row, so it's not valid. So the maximum valid number is
21
.
The only numbers with the sum of digits equals to
4
without zeros are
1111
,
211
,
121
,
112
,
13
,
31
,
22
, and
4
. Numbers
1111
,
211
,
112
,
22
aren't valid, because they have some identical digits in a row. So the maximum valid number is
121
.
