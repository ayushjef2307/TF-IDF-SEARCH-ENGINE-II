A number is called powerful if it is a power of two or a factorial. In other words, the number
m
is powerful if there exists a non-negative integer
d
such that
m=
2
d
or
m=d!
, where
d!=1⋅2⋅…⋅d
(in particular,
0!=1
). For example
1
,
4
, and
6
are powerful numbers, because
1=1!
,
4=
2
2
, and
6=3!
but
7
,
10
, or
18
are not.
You are given a positive integer
n
. Find the minimum number
k
such that
n
can be represented as the sum of
k
distinct powerful numbers, or say that there is no such
k
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
). Description of the test cases follows.
A test case consists of only one line, containing one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
12
).
Output
For each test case print the answer on a separate line.
If
n
can not be represented as the sum of distinct powerful numbers, print
−1
.
Otherwise, print a single positive integer  — the minimum possible value of
k
.

Note
In the first test case,
7
can be represented as
7=1+6
, where
1
and
6
are powerful numbers. Because
7
is not a powerful number, we know that the minimum possible value of
k
in this case is
k=2
.
In the second test case, a possible way to represent
11
as the sum of three powerful numbers is
11=1+4+6
. We can show that there is no way to represent
11
as the sum of two or less powerful numbers.
In the third test case,
240
can be represented as
240=24+32+64+120
. Observe that
240=120+120
is not a valid representation, because the powerful numbers have to be distinct.
In the fourth test case,
17179869184=
2
34
, so
17179869184
is a powerful number and the minimum
k
in this case is
k=1
.
