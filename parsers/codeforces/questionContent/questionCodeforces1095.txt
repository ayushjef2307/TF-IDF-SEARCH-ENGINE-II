For an array of integers
a
, let's define
|a|
as the number of elements in it.
Let's denote two functions:
F(a,k)
is a function that takes an array of integers
a
and a positive integer
k
. The result of this function is the array containing
|a|
first elements of the array that you get by replacing each element of
a
with exactly
k
copies of that element.
For example,
F([2,2,1,3,5,6,8],2)
is calculated as follows: first, you replace each element of the array with
2
copies of it, so you obtain
[2,2,2,2,1,1,3,3,5,5,6,6,8,8]
. Then, you take the first
7
elements of the array you obtained, so the result of the function is
[2,2,2,2,1,1,3]
.
G(a,x,y)
is a function that takes an array of integers
a
and two different integers
x
and
y
. The result of this function is the array
a
with every element equal to
x
replaced by
y
, and every element equal to
y
replaced by
x
.
For example,
G([1,1,2,3,5],3,1)=[3,3,2,1,5]
.
An array
a
is a parent of the array
b
if:
either there exists a positive integer
k
such that
F(a,k)=b
;
or there exist two different integers
x
and
y
such that
G(a,x,y)=b
.
An array
a
is an ancestor of the array
b
if there exists a finite sequence of arrays
c
0
,
c
1
,…,
c
m
(
m≥0
) such that
c
0
is
a
,
c
m
is
b
, and for every
i∈[1,m]
,
c
i−1
is a parent of
c
i
.
And now, the problem itself.
You are given two integers
n
and
k
. Your goal is to construct a sequence of arrays
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
m
in such a way that:
every array
s
i
contains exactly
n
elements, and all elements are integers from
1
to
k
;
for every array
a
consisting of exactly
n
integers from
1
to
k
, the sequence contains at least one array
s
i
such that
s
i
is an ancestor of
a
.
Print the minimum number of arrays in such sequence.
Input
The only line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n,k≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
Print one integer — the minimum number of elements in a sequence of arrays meeting the constraints. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo
998244353
.

Note
Let's analyze the first example.
One of the possible answers for the first example is the sequence
[[2,1,2],[1,2,2]]
. Every array of size
3
consisting of elements from
1
to
2
has an ancestor in this sequence:
for the array
[1,1,1]
, the ancestor is
[1,2,2]
:
F([1,2,2],13)=[1,1,1]
;
for the array
[1,1,2]
, the ancestor is
[1,2,2]
:
F([1,2,2],2)=[1,1,2]
;
for the array
[1,2,1]
, the ancestor is
[2,1,2]
:
G([2,1,2],1,2)=[1,2,1]
;
for the array
[1,2,2]
, the ancestor is
[1,2,2]
;
for the array
[2,1,1]
, the ancestor is
[1,2,2]
:
G([1,2,2],1,2)=[2,1,1]
;
for the array
[2,1,2]
, the ancestor is
[2,1,2]
;
for the array
[2,2,1]
, the ancestor is
[2,1,2]
:
F([2,1,2],2)=[2,2,1]
;
for the array
[2,2,2]
, the ancestor is
[1,2,2]
:
G(F([1,2,2],4),1,2)=G([1,1,1],1,2)=[2,2,2]
.
