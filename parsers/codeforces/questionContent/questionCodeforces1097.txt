There is a sheet of paper that can be represented with a grid of size
n×m
:
n
rows and
m
columns of cells. All cells are colored in white initially.
q
operations have been applied to the sheet. The
i
-th of them can be described as follows:
x
i
y
i
 — choose one of
k
non-white colors and color the entire row
x
i
and the entire column
y
i
in it. The new color is applied to each cell, regardless of whether the cell was colored before the operation.
The sheet after applying all
q
operations is called a coloring. Two colorings are different if there exists at least one cell that is colored in different colors.
How many different colorings are there? Print the number modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of the testcase contains four integers
n,m,k
and
q
(
1≤n,m,k,q≤2⋅
10
5
) — the size of the sheet, the number of non-white colors and the number of operations.
The
i
-th of the following
q
lines contains a description of the
i
-th operation — two integers
x
i
and
y
i
(
1≤
x
i
≤n
;
1≤
y
i
≤m
) — the row and the column the operation is applied to.
The sum of
q
over all testcases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each testcase, print a single integer — the number of different colorings modulo
998244353
.
