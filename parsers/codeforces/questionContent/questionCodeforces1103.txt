Sam started playing with round buckets in the sandbox, while also scattering pebbles. His mom decided to buy him a new bucket, so she needs to solve the following task.
You are given
n
distinct points with integer coordinates
A
1
,
A
2
,…,
A
n
. All points were generated from the square
[−
10
8
,
10
8
]×[−
10
8
,
10
8
]
uniformly and independently.
You are given positive integers
k
,
l
, such that
k≤l≤n
. You want to select a subsegment
A
i
,
A
i+1
,…,
A
i+l−1
of the points array (for some
1≤i≤n+1−l
), and some circle on the plane, containing
≥k
points of the selected subsegment (inside or on the border).
What is the smallest possible radius of that circle?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
l
,
k
(
2≤k≤l≤n≤50000
,
k≤20
).
Each of the next
n
lines contains two integers
x
i
,
y
i
(
−
10
8
≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤
10
8
) — the coordinates of the point
A
i
. It is guaranteed that all points are distinct and were generated independently from uniform distribution on
[−
10
8
,
10
8
]×[−
10
8
,
10
8
]
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
for all test cases does not exceed
50000
.
In the first test, points were not generated from the uniform distribution on
[−
10
8
,
10
8
]×[−
10
8
,
10
8
]
for simplicity. It is the only such test and your solution must pass it.
Hacks are disabled in this problem.
Output
For each test case print a single real number — the answer to the problem.
Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
−9
. Formally let your answer be
a
, jury answer be
b
. Your answer will be considered correct if
|a−b|
max(1,|b|)
≤

Note
In the first test case, we can select subsegment
A
1
,
A
2
and a circle with center
(0,2)
and radius
2
.
In the second test case, we can select subsegment
A
1
,
A
2
,
A
3
,
A
4
and a circle with center
(1,2)
and radius
1
.
