Sam changed his school and on the first biology lesson he got a very interesting task about genes.
You are given
n
arrays, the
i
-th of them contains
m
different integers —
a
i,1
,
a
i,2
,…,
a
i,m
. Also you are given an array of integers
w
of length
n
.
Find the minimum value of
w
i
+
w
j
among all pairs of integers
(i,j)
(
1≤i,j≤n
), such that the numbers
a
i,1
,
a
i,2
,…,
a
i,m
,
a
j,1
,
a
j,2
,…,
a
j,m
are distinct.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
,
m
(
2≤n≤
10
5
,
1≤m≤5
).
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines starts with
m
distinct integers
a
i,1
,
a
i,2
,…,
a
i,m
and then
w
i
follows (
1≤
a
i,j
≤
10
9
,
1≤
w
i
≤
10
9
).
Output
Print a single number — the answer to the problem.
If there are no suitable pairs
(i,j)
, print
−1
.

Note
In the first test the minimum value is
5=
w
3
+
w
4
, because numbers
{2,3,4,5}
are distinct.
In the second test case, there are no suitable pair
(i,j)
.
