A sequence of positive integers is called great for a positive integer
x
, if we can split it into pairs in such a way that in each pair the first number multiplied by
x
is equal to the second number. More formally, a sequence
a
of size
n
is great for a positive integer
x
, if
n
is even and there exists a permutation
p
of size
n
, such that for each
i
(
1≤i≤
n
2
)
a
p
2i−1
⋅x=
a
p
2i
.
Sam has a sequence
a
and a positive integer
x
. Help him to make the sequence great: find the minimum possible number of positive integers that should be added to the sequence
a
to make it great for the number
x
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤20000
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
,
x
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
2≤x≤
10
6
).
The next line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of integers that can be added to the end of
a
to make it a great sequence for the number
x
.

Note
In the first test case, Sam got lucky and the sequence is already great for the number
4
because you can divide it into such pairs:
(1,4)
,
(4,16)
. Thus we can add
0
numbers.
In the second test case, you can add numbers
1
and
14
to the sequence, then you can divide all
8
integers into such pairs:
(1,2)
,
(1,2)
,
(2,4)
,
(7,14)
. It is impossible to add less than
2
integers to fix the sequence.
