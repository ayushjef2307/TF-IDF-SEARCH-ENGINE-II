You have an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. Each element initially has value
0
and color
1
. You are also given
q
queries to perform:
Color

) — the length of array
a
and the number of queries you have to perform.
Each of the next
q
lines contains the query given in the form described in the problem statement.
Output
Print the answers to the queries of the third type on separate lines.
