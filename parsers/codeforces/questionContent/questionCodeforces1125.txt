You are given a permutation
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
of length
n
. You have to choose two integers
l,r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) and reverse the subsegment
[l,r]
of the permutation. The permutation will become
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
l−1
,
p
r
,
p
r−1
,…,
p
l
,
p
r+1
,
p
r+2
,…,
p
n
.
Find the lexicographically smallest permutation that can be obtained by performing exactly one reverse operation on the initial permutation.
Note that for two distinct permutations of equal length
a
and
b
,
a
is lexicographically smaller than
b
if at the first position they differ,
a
has the smaller element.
A permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤500
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤500
) — the length of the permutation.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — the elements of the permutation.
Output
For each test case print the lexicographically smallest permutation you can obtain.

Note
In the first test case, the permutation has length
1
, so the only possible segment is
[1,1]
. The resulting permutation is
[1]
.
In the second test case, we can obtain the identity permutation by reversing the segment
[1,2]
. The resulting permutation is
[1,2,3]
.
In the third test case, the best possible segment is
[2,3]
. The resulting permutation is
[1,2,4,3]
.
In the fourth test case, there is no lexicographically smaller permutation, so we can leave it unchanged by choosing the segment
[1,1]
. The resulting permutation is
[1,2,3,4,5]
.
