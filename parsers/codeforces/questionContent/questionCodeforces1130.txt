You are given two arrays
a
and
b
, both of length
n
.
You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): select an index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and swap
a
i
and
b
i
.
Let's define the cost of the array
a
as
∑
n
i=1
∑
n
j=i+1
(
a
i
+
a
j
)
2
. Similarly, the cost of the array
b
is
∑
n
i=1
∑
n
j=i+1
(
b
i
+
b
j
)
2
.
Your task is to minimize the total cost of two arrays.
Input
Each test case consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤40
) — the number of test cases. The following is a description of the input data sets.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the length of both arrays.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤100
) — elements of the first array.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤100
) — elements of the second array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
100
.
Output
For each test case, print the minimum possible total cost.

Note
In the second test case, in one of the optimal answers after all operations
a=[2,6,4,6]
,
b=[3,7,6,1]
.
The cost of the array
a
equals to
(2+6
