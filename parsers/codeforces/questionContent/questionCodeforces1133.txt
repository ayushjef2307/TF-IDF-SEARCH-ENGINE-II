You have an array
a
of length
n
. You can exactly once select an integer
len
between
1
and
n−1
inclusively, and then sort in non-decreasing order the prefix of the array of length
len
and the suffix of the array of length
n−len
independently.
For example, if the array is
a=[3,1,4,5,2]
, and you choose
len=2
, then after that the array will be equal to
[1,3,2,4,5]
.
Could it be that after performing this operation, the array will not be sorted in non-decreasing order?
Input
There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
4
) — the length of the array.
The second line of the test case contains a sequence of integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the array elements.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
4
.
Output
For each test case of input data, output "YES" (without quotes), if the array may be not sorted in non-decreasing order, output "NO" (without quotes) otherwise. You can output each letter in any case (uppercase or lowercase).

Note
In the first test case, it's possible to select
len=1
, then after operation, the array will not be sorted in non-decreasing order and will be equal to
[2,1,2]
.
In the second test case, it's possible to select
len=3
, then after operation, the array will not be sorted in non-decreasing order and will be equal to
[1,2,3,1]
.
In the third test case, the array will be sorted in non-decreasing order for every possible
len
.
