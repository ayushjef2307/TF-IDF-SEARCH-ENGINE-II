There are
n
weighted points on the
OX
-axis. The coordinate and the weight of the
i
-th point is
x
i
and
w
i
, respectively. All points have distinct coordinates and positive weights. Also,
x
i
<
x
i+1
holds for any
1≤i<n
.
The weighted distance between
i
-th point and
j
-th point is defined as
|
x
i
−
x
j
|⋅(
w
i
+
w
j
)
, where
|val|
denotes the absolute value of
val
.
You should answer
q
queries, where the
i
-th query asks the following: Find the minimum weighted distance among all pairs of distinct points among the points in subarray
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
.
Input
The first line contains 2 integers
n
and
q
(2≤n≤3⋅
10
5
;1≤q≤3⋅
10
5
)
— the number of points and the number of queries.
Then,
n
lines follows, the
i
-th of them contains two integers
x
i
and
w
i
(−

)
— the coordinate and the weight of the
i
-th point.
It is guaranteed that the points are given in the increasing order of
x
.
Then,
q
lines follows, the
i
-th of them contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(1≤

<
r

≤n)
— the given subarray of the
i
-th query.
Output
For each query output one integer, the minimum weighted distance among all pair of distinct points in the given subarray.
