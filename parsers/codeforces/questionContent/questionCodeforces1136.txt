You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
distinct positive integers.
Let's consider an infinite integer set
S
which contains all integers
x
that satisfy at least one of the following conditions:
x=
a
i
for some
1≤i≤n
.
x=2y+1
and
y
is in
S
.
x=4y
and
y
is in
S
.
For example, if
a=[1,2]
then the
10
smallest elements in
S
will be
{1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12}
.
Find the number of elements in
S
that are strictly smaller than
2
p
. Since this number may be too large, print it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
p
(1≤n,p≤2⋅
10
5
)
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
)
.
It is guaranteed that all the numbers in
a
are distinct.
Output
Print a single integer, the number of elements in
S
that are strictly smaller than
2
p
. Remember to print it modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
In the first example, the elements smaller than
2
4
are
{1,3,4,6,7,9,12,13,15}
.
In the second example, the elements smaller than
2
7
are
{5,11,20,23,39,41,44,47,79,80,83,89,92,95}
