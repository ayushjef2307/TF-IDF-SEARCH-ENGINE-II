— Ken Thompson
Fibonacci addition is an operation on an array
X
of integers, parametrized by indices
l
and
r
. Fibonacci addition increases
X
l
by
F
1
, increases
X
l+1
by
F
2
, and so on up to
X
r
which is increased by
F
r−l+1
.
F
i
denotes the
i
-th Fibonacci number (
F
1
=1
,
F
2
=1
,
F
i
=
F
i−1
+
F
i−2
for
i>2
), and all operations are performed modulo
MOD
.
You are given two arrays
A
and
B
of the same length. We will ask you to perform several Fibonacci additions on these arrays with different parameters, and after each operation you have to report whether arrays
A
and
B
are equal modulo
MOD
.
Input
The first line contains 3 numbers
n
,
q
and
MOD
(
1≤n,q≤3⋅
10
5
,1≤MOD≤
10
9
+7
) — the length of the arrays, the number of operations, and the number modulo which all operations are performed.
The second line contains
n
numbers — array
A
(
0≤
A
i
<MOD
).
The third line also contains
n
numbers — array
B
(
0≤
B
i
<MOD
).
The next
q
lines contain character
c
and two numbers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) — operation parameters. If
c
is "A", Fibonacci addition is to be performed on array
A
, and if it is is "B", the operation is to be performed on
B
.
Output
After each operation, print "YES" (without quotes) if the arrays are equal and "NO" otherwise. Letter case does not matter.

Note
Explanation of the test from the condition:
Initially
A=[2,2,1]
,
B=[0,0,0]
.
After operation "A 1 3":
A=[0,0,0]
,
B=[0,0,0]
(addition is modulo 3).
After operation "A 1 3":
A=[1,1,2]
,
B=[0,0,0]
.
After operation "B 1 1":
A=[1,1,2]
,
B=[1,0,0]
.
After operation "B 2 2":
A=[1,1,2]
,
B=[1,1,0]
.
After operation "A 3 3":
A=[1,1,0]
,
B=[1,1,0]
.
