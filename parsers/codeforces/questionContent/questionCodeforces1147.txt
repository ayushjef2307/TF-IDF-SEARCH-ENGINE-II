You are given a connected weighted undirected graph, consisting of
n
vertices and
m
edges.
You are asked
k
queries about it. Each query consists of a single integer
x
. For each query, you select a spanning tree in the graph. Let the weights of its edges be
w
1
,
w
2
,…,
w
n−1
. The cost of a spanning tree is
∑
i=1
n−1
|
w
i
−x|
(the sum of absolute differences between the weights and
x
). The answer to a query is the lowest cost of a spanning tree.
The queries are given in a compressed format. The first
p
(1≤p≤k)
queries
q

are provided explicitly. For queries from

Print the xor of answers to all queries.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤50
;
n−1≤m≤300
) — the number of vertices and the number of edges in the graph.
Each of the next
m
lines contains a description of an undirected edge: three integers
v
,
u
and
w
(
1≤v,u≤n
;
v≠u
;
0≤w≤
10
8
) — the vertices the edge connects and its weight. Note that there might be multiple edges between a pair of vertices. The edges form a connected graph.
The next line contains five integers
p,k,a,b
and
c
(
1≤p≤

5
;
p≤k≤
10
7
;
0≤a,b≤
10
8
;
1≤c≤
10
8
) — the number of queries provided explicitly, the total number of queries and parameters to generate the queries.
The next line contains
p
integers
q
1
,
q
2
,…,
q
p
(
0≤
q
j
<c
) — the first
p
queries.
Output
Print a single integer — the xor of answers to all queries.
