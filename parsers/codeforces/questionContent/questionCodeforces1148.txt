You have an array of integers
a
of size
n
. Initially, all elements of the array are equal to
1
. You can perform the following operation: choose two integers
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and
x
(
x>0
), and then increase the value of
a
i
by
⌊
a
i
x
⌋
(i.e. make
a
i
=
a
i
+⌊
a
i
x
⌋
).
After performing all operations, you will receive
c
i
coins for all such
i
that
a
i
=
b
i
.
Your task is to determine the maximum number of coins that you can receive by performing no more than
k
operations.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤
10
3
;0≤k≤
10
6
) — the size of the array and the maximum number of operations, respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤
10
3
).
The third line contains
n
integers
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
n
(
1≤
c
i
≤
10
6
).
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
3
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of coins that you can get by performing no more than
k
operations.
