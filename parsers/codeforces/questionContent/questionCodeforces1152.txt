This version of the problem differs from the previous one only in the constraint on
n
.
A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A weighted tree has a weight assigned to each edge. The distance between two vertices is the minimum sum of weights on the path connecting them.
You are given a weighted tree with
n
vertices, each edge has a weight of
1
. Denote
d(v)
as the distance between vertex
1
and vertex
v
.
Let
f(x)
be the minimum possible value of
max
1≤v≤n
 d(v)
if you can temporarily add an edge with weight
x
between any two vertices
a
and
b
(1≤a,b≤n)
. Note that after this operation, the graph is no longer a tree.
For each integer
x
from
1
to
n
, find
f(x)
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤3⋅
10
5
).
Each of the next
n−1
lines contains two integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
) indicating that there is an edge between vertices
u
and
v
. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
3⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print
n
integers in a single line,
x
-th of which is equal to
f(x)
for all
x
from
1
to
n
.

Note
In the first testcase:
For
x=1
, we can an edge between vertices
1
and
3
, then
d(1)=0
and
d(2)=d(3)=d(4)=1
, so
f(1)=1
.
For
x≥2
, no matter which edge we add,
d(1)=0
,
d(2)=d(4)=1
and
d(3)=2
, so
f(x)=2
.
