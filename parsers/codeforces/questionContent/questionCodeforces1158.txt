You are given an array
a
of
n
elements. You can apply the following operation to it any number of times:
Select some subarray from
a
of even size
2k
that begins at position
l
(
1≤l≤l+2⋅k−1≤n
,
k≥1
) and for each
i
between
0
and
k−1
(inclusive), assign the value
a
l+k+i
to
a
l+i
.
For example, if
a=[2,1,3,4,5,3]
, then choose
l=1
and
k=2
, applying this operation the array will become
a=[3,4,3,4,5,3]
.
Find the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make all the elements of the array equal.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case consists of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
) — the elements of the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
Print
t
lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case — the minimum number of operations needed to make equal all the elements of the array with the given operation.

Note
In the first test, all elements are equal, therefore no operations are needed.
In the second test, you can apply one operation with
k=1
and
l=1
, set
a
1
:=
a
2
, and the array becomes
[1,1]
with
1
operation.
In the third test, you can apply one operation with
k=1
and
l=4
, set
a
4
:=
a
5
, and the array becomes
[4,4,4,4,4]
.
In the fourth test, you can apply one operation with
k=1
and
l=3
, set
a
3
:=
a
4
, and the array becomes
[4,2,3,3]
, then you can apply another operation with
k=2
and
l=1
, set
a
1
:=
a
3
,
a
2
:=
a
4
, and the array becomes
[3,3,3,3]
.
In the fifth test, there is only one element, therefore no operations are needed.
