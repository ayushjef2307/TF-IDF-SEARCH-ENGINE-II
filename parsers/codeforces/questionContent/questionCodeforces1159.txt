You are given two arrays
a
and
b
of
n
positive integers each. You can apply the following operation to them any number of times:
Select an index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and swap
a
i
with
b
i
(i. e.
a
i
becomes
b
i
and vice versa).
Find the minimum possible value of
max(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
)⋅max(
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
)
you can get after applying such operation any number of times (possibly zero).
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the length of the arrays.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤10000
) where
a
i
is the
i
-th element of the array
a
.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤10000
) where
b
i
is the
i
-th element of the array
b
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer, the minimum possible value of
max(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
)⋅max(
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
)
you can get after applying such operation any number of times.

Note
In the first test, you can apply the operations at indices
2
and
6
, then
a=[1,4,6,5,1,5]
and
b=[3,2,3,2,2,2]
,
max(1,4,6,5,1,5)⋅max(3,2,3,2,2,2)=6⋅3=18
.
In the second test, no matter how you apply the operations,
a=[3,3,3]
and
b=[3,3,3]
will always hold, so the answer is
max(3,3,3)⋅max(3,3,3)=3⋅3=9
.
In the third test, you can apply the operation at index
1
, then
a=[2,2]
,
b=[1,1]
, so the answer is
max(2,2)⋅max(1,1)=2⋅1=2
.
