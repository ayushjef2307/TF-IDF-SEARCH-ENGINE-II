Given a cyclic array
a
of size
n
, where
a
i
is the value of
a
in the
i
-th position, there may be repeated values. Let us define that a permutation of
a
is equal to another permutation of
a
if and only if their values are the same for each position
i
or we can transform them to each other by performing some cyclic rotation. Let us define for a cyclic array
b
its number of components as the number of connected components in a graph, where the vertices are the positions of
b
and we add an edge between each pair of adjacent positions of
b
with equal values (note that in a cyclic array the first and last position are also adjacents).
Find the expected value of components of a permutation of
a
if we select it equiprobably over the set of all the different permutations of
a
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
6
) — the size of the cyclic array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers, the
i
-th of them is the value
a
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
It is guaranteed that the total number of different permutations of
a
is not divisible by
M
Output
For each test case print a single integer — the expected value of components of a permutation of
a
if we select it equiprobably over the set of all the different permutations of
a
modulo
998244353
.
Formally, let
M=998244353
. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction
p
q
, where
p
and
q
are integers and
q≢0(modM)
. Output the integer equal to
p⋅
q
−1
modM
. In other words, output such an integer
x
that
0≤x<M
and
x⋅q≡p(modM)
.

Note
In the first test case there is only
1
different permutation of
a
:
[1,1,1,1]
has
1
component.
Therefore the expected value of components is
1
1
=1
In the second test case there are
4
ways to permute the cyclic array
a
, but there is only
1
different permutation of
a
:
[1,1,1,2]
,
[1,1,2,1]
,
[1,2,1,1]
and
[2,1,1,1]
are the same permutation and have
2
components.
Therefore the expected value of components is
2
1
=2
In the third test case there are
6
ways to permute the cyclic array
a
, but there are only
2
different permutations of
a
:
[1,1,2,2]
,
[2,1,1,2]
,
[2,2,1,1]
and
[1,2,2,1]
are the same permutation and have
2
components.
[1,2,1,2]
and
[2,1,2,1]
are the same permutation and have
4
components.
Therefore the expected value of components is
2+4

=

In the fourth test case there are
120
ways to permute the cyclic array
a
, but there are only
24
different permutations of
a
:
Any permutation of
a
has
5
components.
Therefore the expected value of components is
