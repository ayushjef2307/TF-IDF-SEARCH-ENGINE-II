You are given an array
a
of
n
integers and a set
B
of
m
positive integers such that
1≤
b
i
≤⌊
n
2
⌋
for
1≤i≤m
, where
b
i
is the
i
-th element of
B
.
You can make the following operation on
a
:
Select some
x
such that
x
appears in
B
.
Select an interval from array
a
of size
x
and multiply by
−1
every element in the interval. Formally, select
l
and
r
such that
1≤l≤r≤n
and
r−l+1=x
, then assign
a
i
:=−
a
i
for every
i
such that
l≤i≤r
.
Consider the following example, let
a=[0,6,−2,1,−4,5]
and
B={1,2}
:
[0,6,−2,−1,4,5]
is obtained after choosing size
2
and
l=4
,
r=5
.
[0,6,2,−1,4,5]
is obtained after choosing size
1
and
l=3
,
r=3
.
Find the maximum
∑
i=1
n
a
i
you can get after applying such operation any number of times (possibly zero).
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤
10
6
,
1≤m≤⌊
n
2
⌋
) — the number of elements of
a
and
B
respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
The third line of each test case contains
m
distinct positive integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
m
(
1≤
b
i
≤⌊
n
2
⌋
) — the elements in the set
B
.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each test case print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of all
a
i
after applying such operation any number of times.

Note
In the first test, you can apply the operation
x=1
,
l=3
,
r=3
, and the operation
x=1
,
l=5
,
r=5
, then the array becomes
[0,6,2,1,4,5]
.
In the second test, you can apply the operation
x=2
,
l=2
,
r=3
, and the array becomes
[1,1,−1,−1,1,−1,1]
, then apply the operation
x=2
,
l=3
,
r=4
, and the array becomes
[1,1,1,1,1,−1,1]
. There is no way to achieve a sum bigger than
5
.
