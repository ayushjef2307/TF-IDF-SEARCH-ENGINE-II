You are given
n
elements numbered from
1
to
n
, the element
i
has value
a
i
and color
c
i
, initially,
c
i
=0
for all
i
.
The following operation can be applied:
Select three elements
i
,
j
and
k
(
1≤i<j<k≤n
), such that
c
i
,
c
j
and
c
k
are all equal to
0
and
a
i
=
a
k
, then set
c
j
=1
.
Find the maximum value of
∑
i=1
n
c
i
that can be obtained after applying the given operation any number of times.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
3≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of elements.
The second line consists of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
), where
a
i
is the value of the
i
-th element.
Output
Print a single integer in a line — the maximum value of
∑
i=1
n
c
i
that can be obtained after applying the given operation any number of times.
