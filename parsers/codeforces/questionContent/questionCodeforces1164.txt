Given an array
a
of
n
integers, find a range of values
[x,y]
(
x≤y
), and split
a
into exactly
k
(
1≤k≤n
) subarrays in such a way that:
Each subarray is formed by several continuous elements of
a
, that is, it is equal to
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
for some
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
).
Each element from
a
belongs to exactly one subarray.
In each subarray the number of elements inside the range
[x,y]
(inclusive) is strictly greater than the number of elements outside the range. An element with index
i
is inside the range
[x,y]
if and only if
x≤
a
i
≤y
.
Print any solution that minimizes
y−x
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤3⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array
a
and the number of subarrays required in the partition.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
) where
a
i
is the
i
-th element of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print
k+1
lines.
In the first line, print
x
and
y
— the limits of the found range.
Then print
k
lines, the
i
-th should contain
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
) — the limits of the
i
-th subarray.
You can print the subarrays in any order.

Note
In the first test, there should be only one subarray, which must be equal to the whole array. There are
2
elements inside the range
[1,2]
and
0
elements outside, if the chosen range is
[1,1]
, there will be
1
element inside (
a
1
) and
1
element outside (
a
2
), and the answer will be invalid.
In the second test, it is possible to choose the range
[2,2]
, and split the array in subarrays
(1,3)
and
(4,4)
, in subarray
(1,3)
there are
2
elements inside the range (
a
2
and
a
3
) and
1
element outside (
a
1
), in subarray
(4,4)
there is only
1
element (
a
4
), and it is inside the range.
In the third test, it is possible to choose the range
[5,5]
, and split the array in subarrays
(1,4)
,
(5,7)
and
(8,11)
, in the subarray
(1,4)
there are
3
elements inside the range and
1
element outside, in the subarray
(5,7)
there are
2
elements inside and
1
element outside and in the subarray
(8,11)
there are
3
elements inside and
1
element outside.
