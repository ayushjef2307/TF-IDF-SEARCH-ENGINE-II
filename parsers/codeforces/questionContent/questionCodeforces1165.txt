You are given a set of
n
(
n
is always a power of
2
) elements containing all integers
0,1,2,…,n−1
exactly once.
Find
n
2
pairs of elements such that:
Each element in the set is in exactly one pair.
The sum over all pairs of the bitwise AND of its elements must be exactly equal to
k
. Formally, if
a
i
and
b
i
are the elements of the
i
-th pair, then the following must hold:
∑
i=1
n/2
a
i
&
b
i
=k,
/
2
where
&
denotes the bitwise AND operation.
If there are many solutions, print any of them, if there is no solution, print
−1
instead.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤400
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line with two integers
n
and
k
(
4≤n≤
2
16
,
n
is a power of
2
,
0≤k≤n−1
).
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2
16
. All test cases in each individual input will be pairwise different.
Output
For each test case, if there is no solution, print a single line with the integer
−1
.
Otherwise, print
n
2
lines, the
i
-th of them must contain
a
i
and
b
i
, the elements in the
i
-th pair.
If there are many solutions, print any of them. Print the pairs and the elements in the pairs in any order.

Note
In the first test,
(0&3)+(1&2)=0
.
In the second test,
(0&2)+(1&3)=1
.
In the third test,
(0&1)+(2&3)=2
.
In the fourth test, there is no solution.
