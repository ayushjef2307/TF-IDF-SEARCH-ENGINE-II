Consider the array
a
composed of all the integers in the range
[l,r]
. For example, if
l=3
and
r=7
, then
a=[3,4,5,6,7]
.
Given
l
,
r
, and
k
, is it possible for
gcd(a)
to be greater than
1
after doing the following operation at most
k
times?
Choose
2
numbers from
a
.
Permanently remove one occurrence of each of them from the array.
Insert their product back into
a
.
gcd(b)
denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the integers in
b
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The input for each test case consists of a single line containing
3
non-negative integers
l
,
r
, and
k
(
1≤l≤r≤
10
9
,0≤k≤r−l
).
Output
For each test case, print "YES" if it is possible to have the GCD of the corresponding array greater than
1
by performing at most
k
operations, and "NO" otherwise (case insensitive).

Note
For the first test case,
a=[1]
, so the answer is "NO", since the only element in the array is
1
.
For the second test case the array is
a=[3,4,5]
and we have
1
operation. After the first operation the array can change to:
[3,20]
,
[4,15]
or
[5,12]
all of which having their greatest common divisor equal to
1
so the answer is "NO".
For the third test case,
a=[13]
, so the answer is "YES", since the only element in the array is
13
.
For the fourth test case,
a=[4]
, so the answer is "YES", since the only element in the array is
4
.
