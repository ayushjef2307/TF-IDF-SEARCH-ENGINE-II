Mihai has just learned about the MEX concept and since he liked it so much, he decided to use it right away.
Given an array
a
of
n
non-negative integers, Mihai wants to create a new array
b
that is formed in the following way:
While
a
is not empty:
Choose an integer
k
(
1≤k≤|a|
).
Append the MEX of the first
k
numbers of the array
a
to the end of array
b
and erase them from the array
a
, shifting the positions of the remaining numbers in
a
.
But, since Mihai loves big arrays as much as the MEX concept, he wants the new array
b
to be the lexicographically maximum. So, Mihai asks you to tell him what the maximum array
b
that can be created by constructing the array optimally is.
An array
x
is lexicographically greater than an array
y
if in the first position where
x
and
y
differ
x
i
>
y
i
or if
|x|>|y|
and
y
is a prefix of
x
(where
|x|
denotes the size of the array
x
).
The MEX of a set of non-negative integers is the minimal non-negative integer such that it is not in the set. For example, MEX({
1,2,3
})
=0
and MEX({
0,1,2,4,5
})
=3
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of elements in the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
non-negative integers
a
1
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤n
), where
a
i
is the
i
-th integer from the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print
m
— the length of the maximum array
b
Mihai can create, followed by
m
integers denoting the elements of the array
b
.

Note
In the first test case, the lexicographically maximum array
b
is obtained by selecting
k=5
, resulting in the
MEX
of the whole array
a
. It is lexicographically maximum because an array starting with a smaller number than
4
is lexicographically smaller, and choosing a
k<5
would result in an array starting with a number smaller than
4
.
In the second test case, there are two ways to obtain the maximum array: first selecting
k=6
, then
k=2
, or first selecting
k=7
and then
k=1
.
