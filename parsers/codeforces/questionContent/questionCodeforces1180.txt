There is a grid with
n
rows and
m
columns. Some cells are colored black, and the rest of the cells are colored white.
In one operation, you can select some black cell and do exactly one of the following:
color all cells in its row black, or
color all cells in its column black.
You are given two integers
r
and
c
. Find the minimum number of operations required to make the cell in row
r
and column
c
black, or determine that it is impossible.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four integers
n
,
m
,
r
, and
c
(
1≤n,m≤50
;
1≤r≤n
;
1≤c≤m
) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the grid, and the row and column of the cell you need to turn black, respectively.
Then
n
lines follow, each containing
m
characters. Each of these characters is either 'B' or 'W' — a black and a white cell, respectively.
Output
For each test case, if it is impossible to make the cell in row
r
and column
c
black, output
−1
.
Otherwise, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations required to make the cell in row
r
and column
c
black.

Note
The first test case is pictured below.
We can take the black cell in row
1
and column
2
, and make all cells in its row black. Therefore, the cell in row
1
and column
4
will become black.
In the second test case, the cell in row
2
and column
1
is already black.
In the third test case, it is impossible to make the cell in row
2
and column
2
black.
The fourth test case is pictured below.
We can take the black cell in row
2
and column
2
and make its column black.
Then, we can take the black cell in row
1
and column
2
and make its row black.
Therefore, the cell in row
1
and column
1
will become black.
