There are two water tanks, the first one fits
a
liters of water, the second one fits
b
liters of water. The first tank has
c
(
0≤c≤a
) liters of water initially, the second tank has
d
(
0≤d≤b
) liters of water initially.
You want to perform
n
operations on them. The
i
-th operation is specified by a single non-zero integer
v
i
. If
v
i
>0
, then you try to pour
v
i
liters of water from the first tank into the second one. If
v
i
<0
, you try to pour
−
v
i
liters of water from the second tank to the first one.
When you try to pour
x
liters of water from the tank that has
y
liters currently available to the tank that can fit
z
more liters of water, the operation only moves
min(x,y,z)
liters of water.
For all pairs of the initial volumes of water
(c,d)
such that
0≤c≤a
and
0≤d≤b
, calculate the volume of water in the first tank after all operations are performed.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n,a
and
b
(
1≤n≤
10
4
;
1≤a,b≤1000
) — the number of operations and the capacities of the tanks, respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
v
1
,
v
2
,…,
v
n
(
−1000≤
v
i
≤1000
;
v
i
≠0
) — the volume of water you try to pour in each operation.
Output
For all pairs of the initial volumes of water
(c,d)
such that
0≤c≤a
and
0≤d≤b
, calculate the volume of water in the first tank after all operations are performed.
Print
a+1
lines, each line should contain
b+1
integers. The
j
-th value in the
i
-th line should be equal to the answer for
c=i−1
and
d=j−1
.

Note
Consider
c=3
and
d=2
from the first example:
The first operation tries to move
2
liters of water from the second tank to the first one, the second tank has
2
liters available, the first tank can fit
1
more liter. Thus,
min(2,2,1)=1
liter is moved, the first tank now contains
4
liters, the second tank now contains
1
liter.
The second operation tries to move
1
liter of water from the first tank to the second one.
min(1,4,3)=1
liter is moved, the first tank now contains
3
liters, the second tank now contains
2
liter.
The third operation tries to move
2
liter of water from the first tank to the second one.
min(2,3,2)=2
liters are moved, the first tank now contains
1
liter, the second tank now contains
4
liters.
There's
1
liter of water in the first tank at the end. Thus, the third value in the fourth row is
1
.
