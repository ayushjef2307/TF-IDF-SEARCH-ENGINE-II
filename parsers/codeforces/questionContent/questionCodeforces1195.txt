Masha meets a new friend and learns his phone number —
s
. She wants to remember it as soon as possible. The phone number — is a string of length
m
that consists of digits from
0
to
9
. The phone number may start with 0.
Masha already knows
n
phone numbers (all numbers have the same length
m
). It will be easier for her to remember a new number if the
s
is represented as segments of numbers she already knows. Each such segment must be of length at least
2
, otherwise there will be too many segments and Masha will get confused.
For example, Masha needs to remember the number:
s=
'12345678' and she already knows
n=4
numbers: '12340219', '20215601', '56782022', '12300678'. You can represent
s
as a
3
segment: '1234' of number one, '56' of number two, and '78' of number three. There are other ways to represent
s
.
Masha asks you for help, she asks you to break the string
s
into segments of length
2
or more of the numbers she already knows. If there are several possible answers, print any of them.
Input
The first line of input data contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) —the number of test cases.
Before each test case there is a blank line. Then there is a line containing integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤
10
3
) —the number of phone numbers that Masha knows and the number of digits in each phone number. Then follow
n
line,
i
-th of which describes the
i
-th number that Masha knows. The next line contains the phone number of her new friend
s
.
Among the given
n+1
phones, there may be duplicates (identical phones).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n⋅m
(
n
multiplied by
m
) values over all input test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
Output
You need to print the answers to
t
test cases. The first line of the answer should contain one number
k
, corresponding to the number of segments into which you split the phone number
s
. Print -1 if you cannot get such a split.
If the answer is yes, then follow
k
lines containing triples of numbers
l,r,i
. Such triplets mean that the next
r−l+1
digits of number
s
are equal to a segment (substring) with boundaries
[l,r]
of the phone under number
i
. Both the phones and the digits in them are numbered from
1
. Note that
r−l+1≥2
for all
k
lines.

Note
The example from the statement.
In the second case, it is impossible to represent by segments of known numbers of length 2 or more.
In the third case, you can get the segments '12' and '21' from the first phone number.
