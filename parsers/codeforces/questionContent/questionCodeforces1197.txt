You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
positive integers. You can perform operations on it.
In one operation you can replace any element of the array
a
i
with
⌊
a
i
2
⌋
, that is, by an integer part of dividing
a
i
by
2
(rounding down).
See if you can apply the operation some number of times (possible
0
) to make the array
a
become a permutation of numbers from
1
to
n
 —that is, so that it contains all numbers from
1
to
n
, each exactly once.
For example, if
a=[1,8,25,2]
,
n=4
, then the answer is yes. You could do the following:
Replace
8
with
⌊
8
2
⌋=4
, then
a=[1,4,25,2]
.
Replace
25
with
⌊
25
2
⌋=12
, then
a=[1,4,12,2]
.
Replace
12
with
⌊
12
2
⌋=6
, then
a=[1,4,6,2]
.
Replace
6
with
⌊
6
2
⌋=3
, then
a=[1,4,3,2]
.
Input
The first line of input data contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) —the number of test cases.
Each test case contains exactly two lines. The first one contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤50
), the second one contains integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, output on a separate line:
YES if you can make the array
a
become a permutation of numbers from
1
to
n
,
NO otherwise.
You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
The first test case is explained in the text of the problem statement.
In the second test case, it is not possible to get a permutation.
