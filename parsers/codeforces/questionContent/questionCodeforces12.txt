You are given an array
a
containing the weather forecast for Berlandia for the last
n
days. That is,
a
i
 — is the estimated air temperature on day
i
(
1≤i≤n
).
You are also given an array
b
 — the air temperature that was actually present on each of the days. However, all the values in array
b
are mixed up.
Determine which day was which temperature, if you know that the weather never differs from the forecast by more than
k
degrees. In other words, if on day
i
the real air temperature was
c
, then the equality
|
a
i
−c|≤k
is always true.
For example, let an array
a
= [
1,3,5,3,9
] of length
n=5
and
k=2
be given and an array
b
= [
2,5,11,2,4
]. Then, so that the value of
b
i
corresponds to the air temperature on day
i
, we can rearrange the elements of the array
b
so: [
2,2,5,4,11
]. Indeed:
On the
1

|
a

−
b

is satisfied;
On the

|
a

|=|3−2|=1
,
1≤2=k
is satisfied;
On the
3
rd day,
|
a

−
b

|=|5−5|=0
,
0≤2=k
is satisfied;
On the
4
th day,
|
a

−
b

|=|3−4|=1
,
1≤2=k
is satisfied;
On the
5
th day,
|
a

−
b

|=|9−11|=2
,
2≤2=k
is satisfied.
Input
The first line of input data contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) and
k
(
0≤k≤
10
9
) — the number of days and the maximum difference between the expected and actual air temperature on each day.
The second line of each test case contains exactly
n
integers — elements of array
a
(
−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
The third line of each test case contains exactly
n
integers — elements of array
b
(
−
10
9
≤
b
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
, and that the elements of array
b
can always be rearranged so that the equality
|
a
i
−
b
i
|≤k
is true for all
i
.
Output
On a separate line for each test case, output exactly
n
numbers — the values of air temperature on each of the days in the correct order.
If there is more than one answer — output any of them.
