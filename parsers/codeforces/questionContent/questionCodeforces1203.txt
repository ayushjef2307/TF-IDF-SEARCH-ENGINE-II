Alice and Bob play the following game. Alice has a set
S
of disjoint ranges of integers, initially containing only one range
[1,n]
. In one turn, Alice picks a range
[l,r]
from the set
S
and asks Bob to pick a number in the range. Bob chooses a number
d
(
l≤d≤r
). Then Alice removes
[l,r]
from
S
and puts into the set
S
the range
[l,d−1]
(if
l≤d−1
) and the range
[d+1,r]
(if
d+1≤r
). The game ends when the set
S
is empty. We can show that the number of turns in each game is exactly
n
.
After playing the game, Alice remembers all the ranges
[l,r]
she picked from the set
S
, but Bob does not remember any of the numbers that he picked. But Bob is smart, and he knows he can find out his numbers
d
from Alice's ranges, and so he asks you for help with your programming skill.
Given the list of ranges that Alice has picked (
[l,r]
), for each range, help Bob find the number
d
that Bob has picked.
We can show that there is always a unique way for Bob to choose his number for a list of valid ranges picked by Alice.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤1000
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤1000
).
Each of the next
n
lines contains two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
), denoting the range
[l,r]
that Alice picked at some point.
Note that the ranges are given in no particular order.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
1000
, and the ranges for each test case are from a valid game.
Output
For each test case print
n
lines. Each line should contain three integers
l
,
r
, and
d
, denoting that for Alice's range
[l,r]
Bob picked the number
d
.
You can print the lines in any order. We can show that the answer is unique.
It is not required to print a new line after each test case. The new lines in the output of the example are for readability only.

Note
In the first test case, there is only 1 range
[1,1]
. There was only one range
[1,1]
for Alice to pick, and there was only one number
1
for Bob to pick.
In the second test case,
n=3
. Initially, the set contains only one range
[1,3]
.
Alice picked the range
[1,3]
. Bob picked the number
1
. Then Alice put the range
[2,3]
back to the set, which after this turn is the only range in the set.
Alice picked the range
[2,3]
. Bob picked the number
3
. Then Alice put the range
[2,2]
back to the set.
Alice picked the range
[2,2]
. Bob picked the number
2
. The game ended.
In the fourth test case, the game was played with
n=5
. Initially, the set contains only one range
[1,5]
. The game's turn is described in the following table.
