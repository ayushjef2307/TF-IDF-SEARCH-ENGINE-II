Petya is a math teacher.
n
of his students has written a test consisting of
m
questions. For each student, it is known which questions he has answered correctly and which he has not.
If the student answers the
j
-th question correctly, he gets
p
j
points (otherwise, he gets
0
points). Moreover, the points for the questions are distributed in such a way that the array
p
is a permutation of numbers from
1
to
m
.
For the
i
-th student, Petya knows that he expects to get
x
i
points for the test. Petya wonders how unexpected the results could be. Petya believes that the surprise value of the results for students is equal to
∑
i=1
n
|
x
i
−
r
i
|
, where
r
i
is the number of points that the
i
-th student has got for the test.
Your task is to help Petya find such a permutation
p
for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤10
;
1≤m≤
10
4
) — the number of students and the number of questions, respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
(
0≤
x
i
≤
m(m+1)
2
), where
x
i
is the number of points that the
i
-th student expects to get.
This is followed by
n
lines, the
i
-th line contains the string
s
i
(
|
s
i
|=m;
s
i,j
∈{0,1}
), where
s
i,j
is
1
if the
i
-th student has answered the
j
-th question correctly, and
0
otherwise.
The sum of
m
for all test cases does not exceed
10
4
.
Output
For each test case, print
m
integers — a permutation
p
for which the surprise value of the results is maximum possible. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
