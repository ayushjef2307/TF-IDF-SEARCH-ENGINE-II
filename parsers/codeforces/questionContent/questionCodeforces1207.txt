You are given a binary string (i. e. a string consisting of characters 0 and/or 1)
s
of length
n
. You can perform the following operation with the string
s
at most once: choose a substring (a contiguous subsequence) of
s
having exactly
k
characters 1 in it, and shuffle it (reorder the characters in the substring as you wish).
Calculate the number of different strings which can be obtained from
s
by performing this operation at most once.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤5000
;
0≤k≤n
).
The second line contains the string
s
of length
n
, consisting of characters 0 and/or 1.
Output
Print one integer — the number of different strings which can be obtained from
s
by performing the described operation at most once. Since the answer can be large, output it modulo
998244353
.

Note
Some strings you can obtain in the first example:
to obtain 0110110, you can take the substring from the
1
-st character to the
4
-th character, which is 1100, and reorder its characters to get 0110;
to obtain 1111000, you can take the substring from the
3
-rd character to the
7
-th character, which is 00110, and reorder its characters to get 11000;
to obtain 1100101, you can take the substring from the
5
-th character to the
7
-th character, which is 110, and reorder its characters to get 101.
In the second example,
k=0
so you can only choose the substrings consisting only of 0 characters. Reordering them doesn't change the string at all, so the only string you can obtain is 10010.
