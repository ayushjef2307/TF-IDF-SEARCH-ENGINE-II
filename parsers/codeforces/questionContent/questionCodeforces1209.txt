Berland Music is a music streaming service built specifically to support Berland local artist. Its developers are currently working on a song recommendation module.
So imagine Monocarp got recommended
n
songs, numbered from
1
to
n
. The
i
-th song had its predicted rating equal to
p
i
, where
1≤
p
i
≤n
and every integer from
1
to
n
appears exactly once. In other words,
p
is a permutation.
After listening to each of them, Monocarp pressed either a like or a dislike button. Let his vote sequence be represented with a string
s
, such that
s
i
=0
means that he disliked the
i
-th song, and
s
i
=1
means that he liked it.
Now the service has to re-evaluate the song ratings in such a way that:
the new ratings
q
1
,
q
2
,…,
q
n
still form a permutation (
1≤
q
i
≤n
; each integer from
1
to
n
appears exactly once);
every song that Monocarp liked should have a greater rating than every song that Monocarp disliked (formally, for all
i,j
such that
s
i
=1
and
s
j
=0
,
q
i
>
q
j
should hold).
Among all valid permutations
q
find the one that has the smallest value of
∑
i=1
n
|
p
i
−
q
i
|
, where
|x|
is an absolute value of
x
.
Print the permutation
q
1
,
q
2
,…,
q
n
. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of songs.
The second line of each testcase contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — the permutation of the predicted ratings.
The third line contains a single string
s
, consisting of
n
characters. Each character is either a
0
or a
1
.
0
means that Monocarp disliked the song, and
1
means that he liked it.
The sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each testcase, print a permutation
q
 — the re-evaluated ratings of the songs. If there are multiple answers such that
∑
i=1
n
|
p
i
−
q
i
|
is minimum possible, you can print any of them.

Note
In the first testcase, there exists only one permutation
q
such that each liked song is rating higher than each disliked song: song
1
gets rating
2
and song
2
gets rating
1
.

In the second testcase, Monocarp liked all songs, so all permutations could work. The permutation with the minimum sum of absolute differences is the permutation equal to
p
. Its cost is
0
.
