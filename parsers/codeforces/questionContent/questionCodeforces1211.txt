Consider an array of integers
C=[
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
n
]
of length
n
. Let's build the sequence of arrays
D
0
,
D
1
,
D
2
,…,
D
n
of length
n+1
in the following way:
The first element of this sequence will be equals
C
:
D
0
=C
.
For each
1≤i≤n
array
D
i
will be constructed from
D
i−1
in the following way:
Let's find the lexicographically smallest subarray of
D
i−1
of length
i
. Then, the first
n−i
elements of
D
i
will be equals to the corresponding
n−i
elements of array
D
i−1
and the last
i
elements of
D
i
will be equals to the corresponding elements of the found subarray of length
i
.
Array
x
is subarray of array
y
, if
x
can be obtained by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning of
y
and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end of
y
.
For array
C
let's denote array
D
n
as
op(C)
.
Alice has an array of integers
A=[
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
]
of length
n
. She will build the sequence of arrays
B
0
,
B
1
,…,
B
n
of length
n+1
in the following way:
The first element of this sequence will be equals
A
:
B
0
=A
.
For each
1≤i≤n
array
B
i
will be equals
op(
B
i−1
)
, where
op
is the transformation described above.
She will ask you
q
queries about elements of sequence of arrays
B
0
,
B
1
,…,
B
n
. Each query consists of two integers
i
and
j
, and the answer to this query is the value of the
j
-th element of array
B
i
.
Input
The first line contains the single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of array
A
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
) — the array
A
.
The third line contains the single integer
q
(
1≤q≤
10
6
) — the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
i
,
j
(
1≤i,j≤n
) — parameters of queries.
Output
Output
q
integers: values of
B
i,j
for required
i
,
j
.

Note
In the first test case
B
0
=A=[2,1,3,1]
.
B
1
is constructed in the following way:
Initially,
D
0
=[2,1,3,1]
.
For
i=1
the lexicographically smallest subarray of
D
0
of length
1
is
[1]
, so
D
1
will be
[2,1,3,1]
.
For
i=2
the lexicographically smallest subarray of
D
1
of length
2
is
[1,3]
, so
D
2
will be
[2,1,1,3]
.
For
i=3
the lexicographically smallest subarray of
D
2
of length
3
is
[1,1,3]
, so
D
3
will be
[2,1,1,3]
.
For
i=4
the lexicographically smallest subarray of
D
3
of length
4
is
[2,1,1,3]
, so
D
4
will be
[2,1,1,3]
.
So,
B
1
=op(
B
0
)=op([2,1,3,1])=[2,1,1,3]
.
