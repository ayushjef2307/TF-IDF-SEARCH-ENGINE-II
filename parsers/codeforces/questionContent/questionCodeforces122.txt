You are given a two-dimensional plane, and you need to place
n
chips on it.
You can place a chip only at a point with integer coordinates. The cost of placing a chip at the point
(x,y)
is equal to
|x|+|y|
(where
|a|
is the absolute value of
a
).
The cost of placing
n
chips is equal to the maximum among the costs of each chip.
You need to place
n
chips on the plane in such a way that the Euclidean distance between each pair of chips is strictly greater than
1
, and the cost is the minimum possible.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Next
t
cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
18
) — the number of chips you need to place.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum cost to place
n
chips if the distance between each pair of chips must be strictly greater than
1
.

Note
In the first test case, you can place the only chip at point
(0,0)
with total cost equal to
0+0=0
.
In the second test case, you can, for example, place chips at points
(−1,0)
,
(0,1)
and
(1,0)
with costs
|−1|+|0|=1
,
|0|+|1|=1
and
|0|+|1|=1
. Distance between each pair of chips is greater than
1
(for example, distance between
(−1,0)
and
(0,1)
is equal to
2
–
√
). The total cost is equal to
max(1,1,1)=1
.
In the third test case, you can, for example, place chips at points
(−1,−1)
,
(−1,1)
,
(1,1)
,
(0,0)
and
(0,2)
. The total cost is equal to
max(2,2,2,0,2)=2
.
