You are given an integer
k
and a string
s
that consists only of characters 'a' (a lowercase Latin letter) and '*' (an asterisk).
Each asterisk should be replaced with several (from
0
to
k
inclusive) lowercase Latin letters 'b'. Different asterisk can be replaced with different counts of letter 'b'.
The result of the replacement is called a BA-string.
Two strings
a
and
b
are different if they either have different lengths or there exists such a position
i
that
a
i
≠
b
i
.
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
if and only if one of the following holds:
a
is a prefix of
b
, but
a≠b
;
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
Now consider all different BA-strings and find the
x
-th lexicographically smallest of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤2000
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains three integers
n
,
k
and
x
(
1≤n≤2000
;
0≤k≤2000
;
1≤x≤
10
18
).
n
is the length of string
s
.
The second line of each testcase is a string
s
. It consists of
n
characters, each of them is either 'a' (a lowercase Latin letter) or '*' (an asterisk).
The sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
2000
. For each testcase
x
doesn't exceed the total number of different BA-strings. String
s
contains at least one character 'a'.
Output
For each testcase, print a single string, consisting only of characters 'b' and 'a' (lowercase Latin letters) — the
x
-th lexicographically smallest BA-string.

Note
In the first testcase of the example, BA-strings ordered lexicographically are:
a
ab
abb
abbb
abbbb
In the second testcase of the example, BA-strings ordered lexicographically are:
aa
aba
abba
Note that string "aba" is only counted once, even though there are two ways to replace asterisks with characters 'b' to get it.
