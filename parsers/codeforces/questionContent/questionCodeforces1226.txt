You had
n
positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
arranged in a circle. For each pair of neighboring numbers (
a
1
and
a
2
,
a
2
and
a
3
, ...,
a
n−1
and
a
n
, and
a
n
and
a
1
), you wrote down: are the numbers in the pair equal or not.
Unfortunately, you've lost a piece of paper with the array
a
. Moreover, you are afraid that even information about equality of neighboring elements may be inconsistent. So, you are wondering: is there any array
a
which is consistent with information you have about equality or non-equality of corresponding pairs?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Next
t
cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains a non-empty string
s
consisting of characters E and/or N. The length of
s
is equal to the size of array
n
and
2≤n≤50
. For each
i
from
1
to
n
:
if
s
i
=
E then
a
i
is equal to
a
i+1
(
a
n
=
a
1
for
i=n
);
if
s
i
=
N then
a
i
is not equal to
a
i+1
(
a
n
≠
a
1
for
i=n
).
Output
For each test case, print YES if it's possible to choose array
a
that are consistent with information from
s
you know. Otherwise, print NO.
It can be proved, that if there exists some array
a
, then there exists an array
a
of positive integers with values less or equal to
10
9
.

Note
In the first test case, you can choose, for example,
a
1
=
a
2
=
a
3
=5
.
In the second test case, there is no array
a
, since, according to
s
1
,
a
1
is equal to
a
2
, but, according to
s
2
,
a
2
is not equal to
a
1
.
In the third test case, you can, for example, choose array
a=[20,20,4,50,50,50,20]
.
In the fourth test case, you can, for example, choose
a=[1,3,3,7]
.
