You are given a permutation
p
of
n
elements. A permutation of
n
elements is an array of length
n
containing each integer from
1
to
n
exactly once. For example,
[1,2,3]
and
[4,3,5,1,2]
are permutations, but
[1,2,4]
and
[4,3,2,1,2]
are not permutations. You should perform
q
queries.
There are two types of queries:
1
x
y
— swap
p
x
and
p
y
.
2
i
k
— print the number that
i
will become if we assign
i=
p
i
k
times.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
.
Each of the next
q
lines contains three integers. The first integer is
t
(
1≤t≤2
) — type of query. If
t=1
, then the next two integers are
x
and
y
(
1≤x,y≤n
;
x≠y
) — first-type query. If
t=2
, then the next two integers are
i
and
k
(
1≤i,k≤n
) — second-type query.
It is guaranteed that there is at least one second-type query.
Output
For every second-type query, print one integer in a new line — answer to this query.

Note
In the first example
p={5,3,4,2,1}
.
The first query is to print
p
3
. The answer is
4
.
The second query is to print
p
p
1
. The answer is
1
.
The third query is to swap
p
1
and
p
3
. Now
p={4,3,5,2,1}
.
The fourth query is to print
p
p
1
. The answer is
2
.
