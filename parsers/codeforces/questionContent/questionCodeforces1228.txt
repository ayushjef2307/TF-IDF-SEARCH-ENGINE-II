Polycarp is very fond of playing the game Minesweeper. Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules.
There are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known (
x
i
,
y
i
). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of
k
(two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a "plus" symbol ('+'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.
Also, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode instantly and also instantly detonate other mines according to the rules described above.
Polycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases in the test.
An empty line is written in front of each test suite.
Next comes a line that contains integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
0≤k≤
10
9
) — the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.
Then
n
lines follow, the
i
-th of which describes the
x
and
y
coordinates of the
i
-th mine and the time until its explosion (
−
10
9
≤x,y≤
10
9
,
0≤timer≤
10
9
). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the values
n
over all test cases in the test does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
Print
t
lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data  — the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.

Note
Picture from examples
First example:
0
second: we explode a mine at the cell
(2,2)
, it does not detonate any other mine since
k=0
.
1
second: we explode the mine at the cell
(0,1)
, and the mine at the cell
(0,0)
explodes itself.
2
second: we explode the mine at the cell
(1,1)
, and the mine at the cell
(1,0)
explodes itself.
Second example:
0
second: we explode a mine at the cell
(2,2)
we get:
1
second: the mine at coordinate
(0,0)
explodes and since
k=2
the explosion detonates mines at the cells
(0,1)
and
(1,0)
, and their explosions detonate the mine at the cell
(1,1)
and there are no mines left on the field.
