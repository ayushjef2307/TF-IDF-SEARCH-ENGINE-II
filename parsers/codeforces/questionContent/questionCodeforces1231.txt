Vlad has
n
friends, for each of whom he wants to buy one gift for the New Year.
There are
m
shops in the city, in each of which he can buy a gift for any of his friends. If the
j
-th friend (
1≤j≤n
) receives a gift bought in the shop with the number
i
(
1≤i≤m
), then the friend receives
p
ij
units of joy. The rectangular table
p
ij
is given in the input.
Vlad has time to visit at most
n−1
shops (where
n
is the number of friends). He chooses which shops he will visit and for which friends he will buy gifts in each of them.
Let the
j
-th friend receive
a
j
units of joy from Vlad's gift. Let's find the value
α=min{
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
}
. Vlad's goal is to buy gifts so that the value of
α
is as large as possible. In other words, Vlad wants to maximize the minimum of the joys of his friends.
For example, let
m=2
,
n=2
. Let the joy from the gifts that we can buy in the first shop:
p
11
=1
,
p
12
=2
, in the second shop:
p
21
=3
,
p
22
=4
.
Then it is enough for Vlad to go only to the second shop and buy a gift for the first friend, bringing joy
3
, and for the second — bringing joy
4
. In this case, the value
α
will be equal to
min{3,4}=3
Help Vlad choose gifts for his friends so that the value of
α
is as high as possible. Please note that each friend must receive one gift. Vlad can visit at most
n−1
shops (where
n
is the number of friends). In the shop, he can buy any number of gifts.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases in the input.
An empty line is written before each test case. Then there is a line containing integers
m
and
n
(
2≤n
,
2≤n⋅m≤
10
5
) separated by a space — the number of shops and the number of friends, where
n⋅m
is the product of
n
and
m
.
Then
m
lines follow, each containing
n
numbers. The number in the
i
-th row of the
j
-th column
p
ij
(
1≤
p
ij
≤
10
9
) is the joy of the product intended for friend number
j
in shop number
i
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the values
n⋅m
over all test cases in the test does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
Print
t
lines, each line must contain the answer to the corresponding test case — the maximum possible value of
α
, where
α
is the minimum of the joys from a gift for all of Vlad's friends.
