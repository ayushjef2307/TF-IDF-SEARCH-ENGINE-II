Polycarp likes squares and cubes of positive integers. Here is the beginning of the sequence of numbers he likes:
1
,
4
,
8
,
9
, ....
For a given number
n
, count the number of integers from
1
to
n
that Polycarp likes. In other words, find the number of such
x
that
x
is a square of a positive integer number or a cube of a positive integer number (or both a square and a cube simultaneously).
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤20
) — the number of test cases.
Then
t
lines contain the test cases, one per line. Each of the lines contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, print the answer you are looking for — the number of integers from
1
to
n
that Polycarp likes.
