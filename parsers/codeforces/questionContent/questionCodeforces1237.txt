n
towns are arranged in a circle sequentially. The towns are numbered from
1
to
n
in clockwise order. In the
i
-th town, there lives a singer with a repertoire of
a
i
minutes for each
i∈[1,n]
.
Each singer visited all
n
towns in clockwise order, starting with the town he lives in, and gave exactly one concert in each town. In addition, in each town, the
i
-th singer got inspired and came up with a song that lasts
a
i
minutes. The song was added to his repertoire so that he could perform it in the rest of the cities.
Hence, for the
i
-th singer, the concert in the
i
-th town will last
a
i
minutes, in the
(i+1)
-th town the concert will last
2⋅
a
i
minutes, ..., in the
((i+k)modn+1)
-th town the duration of the concert will be
(k+2)⋅
a
i
, ..., in the town
((i+n−2)modn+1)
—
n⋅
a
i
minutes.
You are given an array of
b
integer numbers, where
b
i
is the total duration of concerts in the
i
-th town. Reconstruct any correct sequence of positive integers
a
or say that it is impossible.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(1≤t≤
10
3
) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤4⋅
10
4
) — the number of cities. The second line contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤
10
9
) — the total duration of concerts in
i
-th city.
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print the answer as follows:
If there is no suitable sequence
a
, print NO. Otherwise, on the first line print YES, on the next line print the sequence
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of
n
integers, where
a
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) is the initial duration of repertoire of the
i
-th singer. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note
Let's consider the
1
-st test case of the example:
the
1
-st singer in the
1
-st city will give a concert for
3
minutes, in the
2
-nd — for
6
minutes, in the
3
-rd — for
9
minutes;
the
2
-nd singer in the
1
-st city will give a concert for
3
minutes, in the
2
-nd — for
1
minute, in the
3
-rd - for
2
minutes;
the
3
-rd singer in the
1
-st city will give a concert for
6
minutes, in the
2
-nd — for
9
minutes, in the
3
-rd — for
3
minutes.
