Given a positive integer
n
. Find three distinct positive integers
a
,
b
,
c
such that
a+b+c=n
and
gcd(a,b)=c
, where
gcd(x,y)
denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers
x
and
y
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
10≤n≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, output three distinct positive integers
a
,
b
,
c
satisfying the requirements. If there are multiple solutions, you can print any. We can show that an answer always exists.

Note
In the first test case,
6+9+3=18
and
gcd(6,9)=3
.
In the second test case,
21+39+3=63
and
gcd(21,39)=3
.
In the third test case,
29+43+1=73
and
gcd(29,43)=1
.
