You are given strings
S
and
T
, consisting of lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that
T
is a permutation of the string abc.
Find string
S
′
, the lexicographically smallest permutation of
S
such that
T
is not a subsequence of
S
′
.
String
a
is a permutation of string
b
if the number of occurrences of each distinct character is the same in both strings.
A string
a
is a subsequence of a string
b
if
a
can be obtained from
b
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
if and only if one of the following holds:
a
is a prefix of
b
, but
a≠b
;
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a string
S
(
1≤|S|≤100
), consisting of lowercase English letters.
The second line of each test case contains a string
T
that is a permutation of the string abc. (Hence,
|T|=3
).
Note that there is no limit on the sum of
|S|
across all test cases.
Output
For each test case, output a single string
S
′
, the lexicographically smallest permutation of
S
such that
T
is not a subsequence of
S
′
.

Note
In the first test case, both aaaabbc and aaaabcb are lexicographically smaller than aaaacbb, but they contain abc as a subsequence.
In the second test case, abccc is the smallest permutation of cccba and does not contain acb as a subsequence.
In the third test case, bcdis is the smallest permutation of dbsic and does not contain bac as a subsequence.
