You are given a directed acyclic graph with
n
vertices and
m
edges. For all edges
a→b
in the graph,
a<b
holds.
You need to find the number of pairs of vertices
x
,
y
, such that
x>y
and after adding the edge
x→y
to the graph, it has a Hamiltonian path.
Input
The first line of input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤5
): the number of test cases.
The next lines contains the descriptions of the test cases.
In the first line you are given two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤150000
,
0≤m≤min(150000,
n(n−1)
2
)
): the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
Each of the next
m
lines contains two integers
a
,
b
(
1≤a<b≤n
), specifying an edge
a→b
in the graph. No edge
a→b
appears more than once.
Output
For each test case, print one integer: the number of pairs of vertices
x
,
y
,
x>y
, such that after adding the edge
x→y
to the graph, it has a Hamiltonian path.

Note
In the first example, any edge
x→y
such that
x>y
is valid, because there already is a path
1→2→3
.
In the second example only the edge
4→1
is valid. There is a path
3→4→1→2
if this edge is added.
In the third example you can add edges
2→1
,
3→1
,
4→1
,
4→2
.
