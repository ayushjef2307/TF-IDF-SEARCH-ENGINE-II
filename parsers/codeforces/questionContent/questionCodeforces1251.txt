You are given two strings
s
and
t
of equal length
n
. In one move, you can swap any two adjacent characters of the string
s
.
You need to find the minimal number of operations you need to make string
s
lexicographically smaller than string
t
.
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
if and only if one of the following holds:
a
is a prefix of
b
, but
a≠b
;
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
Input
The first line of input contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤10000
): the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains the string
s
consisting of
n
lowercase English letters.
The third line of each test case contains the string
t
consisting of
n
lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print in a separate line the minimal number of operations you need to make string
s
lexicographically smaller than string
t
, or
−1
, if it's impossible.
