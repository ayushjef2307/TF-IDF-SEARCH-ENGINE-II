You have a string
s

s
n
and you stand on the left of the string looking right. You want to choose an index
k
(
1≤k≤n
) and place a mirror after the
k
-th letter, so that what you see is

. What is the lexicographically smallest string you can see?
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
if and only if one of the following holds:
a
is a prefix of
b
, but
a≠b
;
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
Input
The first line of input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤10000
): the number of test cases.
The next
t
lines contain the description of the test cases, two lines per a test case.
In the first line you are given one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
): the length of the string.
The second line contains the string
s
consisting of
n
lowercase English characters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print the lexicographically smallest string you can see.

Note
In the first test case choose
k=1
to obtain "cc".
In the second test case choose
k=3
to obtain "cbaabc".
In the third test case choose
k=1
to obtain "aa".
In the fourth test case choose
k=1
to obtain "bb".
