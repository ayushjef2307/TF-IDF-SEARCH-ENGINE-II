inputstandard input
outputstandard output
You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
non-negative integers.
You have to replace each
0
in
a
with an integer from
1
to
n
(different elements equal to
0
can be replaced by different integers).
The value of the array you obtain is the number of integers
k
from
1
to
n
such that the following condition holds: there exist a pair of adjacent elements equal to
k
(i. e. there exists some
i∈[1,n−1]
such that
a
i
=
a
i+1
=k
). If there are multiple such pairs for some integer
k
, this integer is counted in the value only once.
Your task is to obtain the array with the maximum possible value.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤3⋅
10
5
) — the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤min(n,600)
) — the elements of the array.
Output
Print
n
integers not less than
1
and not greater than
n
 — the array with the maximum possible value you can obtain.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
