This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the three versions is the constraints on
n
and
k
. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.
Maxim is a minibus driver on Venus.
To ride on Maxim's minibus, you need a ticket. Each ticket has a number consisting of
n
digits. However, as we know, the residents of Venus use a numeral system with base
k
, rather than the decimal system. Therefore, the ticket number can be considered as a sequence of
n
integers from
0
to
k−1
, inclusive.
The residents of Venus consider a ticket to be lucky if there is a digit on it that is equal to the sum of the remaining digits, modulo
k
. For example, if
k=10
, then the ticket
7135
is lucky because
7+1+5≡3(mod10)
. On the other hand, the ticket
7136
is not lucky because no digit is equal to the sum of the others modulo
10
.
Once, while on a trip, Maxim wondered: how many lucky tickets exist? At the same time, Maxim understands that this number can be very large, so he is interested only in the answer modulo some prime number
m
.
Input
The only line of the input contains three integers
n
,
k
and
m
(
1≤n≤100
,
1≤k≤30
,

≤m≤

+7
,
m
is a prime number) — the number of digits on the ticket, the base of the numeral system on Venus, and the module for answer calculation.
Output
Print one integer — the number of lucky tickets modulo
m
, i. e. the remainder after dividing the answer by
m
.
