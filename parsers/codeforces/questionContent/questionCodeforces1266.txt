This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is maximum value of
a
i
.
Once in Kostomuksha Divan found an array
a
consisting of positive integers. Now he wants to reorder the elements of
a
to maximize the value of the following function:
∑
i=1
n
gcd(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
i
),
n
where
gcd(
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
k
)
denotes the greatest common divisor of integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
k
, and
gcd(x)=x
for any integer
x
.
Reordering elements of an array means changing the order of elements in the array arbitrary, or leaving the initial order.
Of course, Divan can solve this problem. However, he found it interesting, so he decided to share it with you.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the size of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤5⋅

) — the array
a
.
Output
Output the maximum value of the function that you can get by reordering elements of the array
a
.

Note
In the first example, it's optimal to rearrange the elements of the given array in the following order:
[6,2,2,2,3,1]
:

It can be shown that it is impossible to get a better answer.
In the second example, it's optimal to rearrange the elements of a given array in the following order:
[100,10,10,5,1,3,3,7,42,54]
.
