Petya and his friend, the robot Petya++, have a common friend — the cyborg Petr#. Sometimes Petr# comes to the friends for a cup of tea and tells them interesting problems.
Today, Petr# told them the following problem.
A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example,
[38,12,8,12,38]
,
[1]
, and
[3,8,8,3]
are palindromes.
Let's call the palindromicity of a sequence
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
the minimum count of elements that need to be replaced to make this sequence a palindrome. For example, the palindromicity of the sequence
[38,12,8,38,38]
is
1
since it is sufficient to replace the number
38
at the fourth position with the number
12
. And the palindromicity of the sequence
[3,3,5,5,5]
is two since you can replace the first two threes with fives, and the resulting sequence
[5,5,5,5,5]
is a palindrome.
Given a sequence
a
of length
n
, and an odd integer
k
, you need to find the sum of palindromicity of all subarrays of length
k
, i. e., the sum of the palindromicity values for the sequences
a
i
,
a
i+1
,…,
a
i+k−1
for all
i
from
1
to
n−k+1
.
The students quickly solved the problem. Can you do it too?
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤k≤n
,
k
is odd) — the length of the sequence and the length of subarrays for which it is necessary to determine whether they are palindromes.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤2⋅
10
5
) — the sequence itself.
Output
Output a single integer — the total palindromicity of all subarrays of length
k
.

Note
In the first example, the palindromicity of the subarray
[1,2,8,2,5]
is
1
, the palindromicity of the string
[2,8,2,5,2]
is also
1
, the palindromicity of the string
[8,2,5,2,8]
is
0
, and the palindromicity of the string
[2,5,2,8,6]
is
2
. The total palindromicity is
1+1+0+2=4
.
In the second example, the only substring of length
9
coincides with the entire string, and its palindromicity is
0
, so the answer is also
0
.
