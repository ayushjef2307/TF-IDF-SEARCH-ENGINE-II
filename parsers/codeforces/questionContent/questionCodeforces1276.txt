You are given an array
c=[
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
m
]
. An array
a=[
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
]
is constructed in such a way that it consists of integers
1,2,…,m
, and for each
i∈[1,m]
, there are exactly
c
i
occurrences of integer
i
in
a
. So, the number of elements in
a
is exactly
∑
i=1
m
c
i
.
Let's define for such array
a
the value
f(a)
as
f(a)=
∑
1≤i<j≤n
a
i
=
a
j
j−i.
f
(
)
∑
j
i
In other words,
f(a)
is the total sum of distances between all pairs of equal elements.
Your task is to calculate the maximum possible value of
f(a)
and the number of arrays yielding the maximum possible value of
f(a)
. Two arrays are considered different, if elements at some position differ.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
m
(
1≤m≤5⋅
10
5
) — the size of the array
c
.
The second line contains
m
integers
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
m
(
1≤
c
i
≤
10
6
) — the array
c
.
Output
Print two integers — the maximum possible value of
f(a)
and the number of arrays
a
with such value. Since both answers may be too large, print them modulo
10

+7
.

Note
In the first example, all possible arrays
a
are permutations of
[1,2,3,4,5,6]
. Since each array
a
will have
f(a)=0
, so maximum value is
f(a)=0
and there are
6!=720
such arrays.
In the second example, the only possible array consists of
10
6
ones and its
f(a)=
∑
1≤i<j≤
