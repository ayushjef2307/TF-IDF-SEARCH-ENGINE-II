You are given a pair of integers
(a,b)
and an integer
x
.
You can change the pair in two different ways:
set (assign)
a:=|a−b|
;
set (assign)
b:=|a−b|
,
where
|a−b|
is the absolute difference between
a
and
b
.
The pair
(a,b)
is called
x
-magic if
x
is obtainable either as
a
or as
b
using only the given operations (i.e. the pair
(a,b)
is
x
-magic if
a=x
or
b=x
after some number of operations applied). You can apply the operations any number of times (even zero).
Your task is to find out if the pair
(a,b)
is
x
-magic or not.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The next
t
lines describe test cases.
The only line of the test case contains three integers
a
,
b
and
x
(
1≤a,b,x≤
10
18
).
Output
For the
i
-th test case, print YES if the corresponding pair
(a,b)
is
x
-magic and NO otherwise.
