A permutation of length
n
is an array
p=[
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
]
which contains every integer from
1
to
n
(inclusive) exactly once. For example,
p=[4,2,6,5,3,1]
is a permutation of length
6
.
You are given three integers
n
,
a
and
b
, where
n
is an even number. Print any permutation of length
n
that the minimum among all its elements of the left half equals
a
and the maximum among all its elements of the right half equals
b
. Print -1 if no such permutation exists.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
), the number of test cases in the test. The following
t
lines contain test case descriptions.
Each test case description contains three integers
n
,
a
,
b
(
2≤n≤100
;
1≤a,b≤n
;
a≠b
), where
n
is an even number (i.e.
nmod2=0
).
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing any suitable permutation. Print -1 no such permutation exists. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
