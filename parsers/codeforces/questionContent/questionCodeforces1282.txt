Let's denote the Manhattan distance between two points
p

(with coordinates
(
x
1
,
y
1
)
) and
p
2
(with coordinates
(
x

)
) as
d(

. For example, the distance between two points with coordinates
(1,3)
and
(4,2)
is
|1−4|+|3−2|=4
.
You are given two points,
A
and
B
. The point
A
has coordinates
(0,0)
, the point
B
has coordinates
(x,y)
.
Your goal is to find a point
C
such that:
both coordinates of
C
are non-negative integers;
d(A,C)=
d(A,B)
2
(without any rounding);
d(B,C)=
d(A,B)
2
(without any rounding).
Find any point
C
that meets these constraints, or report that no such point exists.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤3000
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing two integers
x
and
y
(
0≤x,y≤50
) — the coordinates of the point
B
.
Output
For each test case, print the answer on a separate line as follows:
if it is impossible to find a point
C
meeting the constraints, print "-1 -1" (without quotes);
otherwise, print two non-negative integers not exceeding
10
6
— the coordinates of point
C
meeting the constraints. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. It can be shown that if any such point exists, it's possible to find a point with coordinates not exceeding
10
6
that meets the constraints.

Note
Explanations for some of the test cases from the example:
In the first test case, the point
B
has coordinates
(49,3)
. If the point
C
has coordinates
(23,3)
, then the distance from
A
to
B
is
|49−0|+|3−0|=52
, the distance from
A
to
C
is
|23−0|+|3−0|=26
, and the distance from
B
to
C
is
|23−49|+|3−3|=26
.
In the second test case, the point
B
has coordinates
(2,50)
. If the point
C
has coordinates
(1,25)
, then the distance from
A
to
B
is
|2−0|+|50−0|=52
, the distance from
A
to
C
is
|1−0|+|25−0|=26
, and the distance from
B
to
C
is
|1−2|+|25−50|=26
.
In the third and the fourth test cases, it can be shown that no point with integer coordinates meets the constraints.
In the fifth test case, the point
B
has coordinates
(42,0)
. If the point
C
has coordinates
(21,0)
, then the distance from
A
to
B
is
|42−0|+|0−0|=42
, the distance from
A
to
C
is
|21−0|+|0−0|=21
, and the distance from
B
to
C
is
|21−42|+|0−0|=21
.
