Let's call an array of

c

Let
AVG
be the

c
k
k
(the average of all the elements of the array, it doesn't have to be integer). Then the number of elements of the array which are bigger than
AVG
should be strictly larger than the number of elements of the array which are smaller than
AVG
. Note that elements equal to
AVG
don't count.
For example
c={1,4,4,5,6}
is terrible because
AVG=4.0
and
5
-th and
4
-th elements are greater than
AVG
and
1
-st element is smaller than
AVG
.

You are given an array of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. Find the minimum number of elements that you have to delete from it to obtain a good array.
An array is a subsequence of another array if it can be obtained from it by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the size of
a
.
The second line of each testcase contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — elements of array
a
.
In each testcase for any
1≤i<n
it is guaranteed that
a
i
≤
a
i+1
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each testcase, print the minimum number of elements that you have to delete from it to obtain a good array.

Note
In the first sample, the array
a
is already good.
In the second sample, it's enough to delete
1
, obtaining array
[4,4,5,6]
, which is good.
