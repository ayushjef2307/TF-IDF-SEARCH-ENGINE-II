Lee couldn't sleep lately, because he had nightmares. In one of his nightmares (which was about an unbalanced global round), he decided to fight back and propose a problem below (which you should solve) to balance the round, hopefully setting him free from the nightmares.
A non-empty array
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
m
is called good, if there exist
m
integer sequences which satisfy the following properties:
The
i
-th sequence consists of
b
i
consecutive integers (for example if
b
i
=3
then the
i
-th sequence can be
(−1,0,1)
or
(−5,−4,−3)
but not
(0,−1,1)
or
(1,2,3,4)
).
Assuming the sum of integers in the
i
-th sequence is
su
m
i
, we want
su
m
1
+su
m
2
+…+su
m
m
to be equal to
0
.
You are given an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. It has
2
n
−1
nonempty subsequences. Find how many of them are good.
As this number can be very large, output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
An array
c
is a subsequence of an array
d
if
c
can be obtained from
d
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the size of array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — elements of the array.
Output
Print a single integer — the number of nonempty good subsequences of
a
, modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
For the first test, two examples of good subsequences are
[2,7]
and
[2,2,4,7]
:
For
b=[2,7]
we can use
(−3,−4)
as the first sequence and
(−2,−1,…,4)
as the second. Note that subsequence
[2,7]
appears twice in
[2,2,4,7]
, so we have to count it twice.
Green circles denote
(−3,−4)
and orange squares denote
(−2,−1,…,4)
.
For
b=[2,2,4,7]
the following sequences would satisfy the properties:
(−1,0)
,
(−3,−2)
,
(0,1,2,3)
and
(−3,−2,…,3)
