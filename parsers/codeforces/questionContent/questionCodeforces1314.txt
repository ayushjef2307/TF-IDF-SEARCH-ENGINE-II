Given
n
, find any array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of integers such that all of the following conditions hold:
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
for every
i
from
1
to
n
.
a
1
<
a
2
<…<
a
n
For every
i
from
2
to
n
,
a
i
isn't divisible by
a
i−1
It can be shown that such an array always exists under the constraints of the problem.
Input
The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
). Description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤1000
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
4
.
Output
For each test case print
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
— the array you found. If there are multiple arrays satisfying all the conditions, print any of them.

Note
In the first test case, array
[1]
satisfies all the conditions.
In the second test case, array
[2,3]
satisfies all the conditions, as
2<3
and
3
is not divisible by
2
.
In the third test case, array
[111,1111,11111,111111,1111111,11111111,111111111]
satisfies all the conditions, as it's increasing and
a
i
isn't divisible by
a
i−1
for any
i
from
2
to
7
.
