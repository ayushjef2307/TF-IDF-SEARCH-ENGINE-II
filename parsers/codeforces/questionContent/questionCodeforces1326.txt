In Berland,
n
different types of banknotes are used. Banknotes of the
i
-th type have denomination
10
a
i
burles (burles are the currency used in Berland); the denomination of banknotes of the first type is exactly
1
.
Let's denote
f(s)
as the minimum number of banknotes required to represent exactly
s
burles. For example, if the denominations of banknotes used in Berland are
1
,
10
and
100
, then
f(59)=14
:
9
banknotes with denomination of
1
burle and
5
banknotes with denomination of
10
burles can be used to represent exactly
9⋅1+5⋅10=59
burles, and there's no way to do it with fewer banknotes.
For a given integer
k
, find the minimum positive number of burles
s
that cannot be represented with
k
or fewer banknotes (that is,
f(s)>k
).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤10;1≤k≤
10
9
).
The next line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0=
a
1
<
a
2
<⋯<
a
n
≤9
).
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum positive number of burles
s
that cannot be represented with
k
or fewer banknotes.
