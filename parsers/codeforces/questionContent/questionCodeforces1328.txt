You are given a string
s
of length
n
consisting of characters a and/or b.
Let
AB(s)
be the number of occurrences of string ab in
s
as a substring. Analogically,
BA(s)
is the number of occurrences of ba in
s
as a substring.
In one step, you can choose any index
i
and replace
s
i
with character a or b.
What is the minimum number of steps you need to make to achieve
AB(s)=BA(s)
?
Reminder:
The number of occurrences of string
d
in
s
as substring is the number of indices
i
(
1≤i≤|s|−|d|+1
) such that substring
s
i
s
i+1
…
s
i+|d|−1
is equal to
d
. For example,
AB(
aabbbabaa
)=2
since there are two indices
i
:
i=2
where aabbbabaa and
i=6
where aabbbabaa.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤1000
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single string
s
(
1≤|s|≤100
, where
|s|
is the length of the string
s
), consisting only of characters a and/or b.
Output
For each test case, print the resulting string
s
with
AB(s)=BA(s)
you'll get making the minimum number of steps.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

b
aabbbabaa
abbb
abbaab
output
Copy
b
aabbbabaa
bbbb
abbaaa
Note
In the first test case, both
AB(s)=0
and
BA(s)=0
(there are no occurrences of ab (ba) in b), so can leave
s
untouched.
In the second test case,
AB(s)=2
and
BA(s)=2
, so you can leave
s
untouched.
In the third test case,
AB(s)=1
and
BA(s)=0
. For example, we can change
s
1
to b and make both values zero.
In the fourth test case,
AB(s)=2
and
BA(s)=1
. For example, we can change
s
6
to a and make both values equal to
1
.
