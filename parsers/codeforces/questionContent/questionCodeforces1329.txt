An integer array
a
of length
n
is said to be a PalindORme if (
a
1
|
a
2
|
…
|
a
i
)=(
a
n−i+1
|
…
|
a
n−1
|
a
n
)
for all
1≤i≤n
, where
|
denotes the bitwise OR operation.
An integer array
a
of length
n
is considered to be good if its elements can be rearranged to form a PalindORme. Formally, array
a
is good if there exists a permutation
p
1
,
p
2
,…
p
n
(an array where each integer from
1
to
n
appears exactly once) for which
a
p
1
,
a
p
2
,…
a
p
n
is a PalindORme.
Find the number of good arrays of length
n
, consisting only of integers in the range
[0,
2
k
−1]
, and print it modulo some prime
m
.
Two arrays
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
are considered to be different if there exists any
i
(1≤i≤n)
such that
a
i
≠
b
i
.
Input
The first and only line of the input contains three integers
n
,
k
and
m
(
1≤n,k≤80
,
10

<m<
10

). It is guaranteed that
m
is prime.
Output
Print a single integer  — the number of good arrays modulo
m
.

Note
In the first sample, both the possible arrays
[0]
and
[1]
are good.
In the second sample, some examples of good arrays are:
[2,1,2]
because it is already PalindORme.
[1,1,0]
because it can rearranged to
[1,0,1]
which is PalindORme
Note that
[1,1,0]
,
[1,0,1]
and
[0,1,1]
are all good arrays and are considered to be different according to the definition in the statement.
In the third sample, an example of a good array is
[1,0,1,4,2,5,4]
. It can be rearranged to an array
b=[1,5,0,2,4,4,1]
which is a PalindORme because:
OR(1,1)
=
OR(7,7)
=
1
OR(1,2)
=
OR(6,7)
=
5
OR(1,3)
=
OR(5,7)
=
5
OR(1,4)
=
OR(4,7)
=
7
OR(1,5)
=
OR(3,7)
=
7
OR(1,6)
=
OR(2,7)
=
7
OR(1,7)
=
OR(1,7)
=
7
