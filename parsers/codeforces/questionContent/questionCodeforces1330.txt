Jeevan has two arrays
a
and
b
of size
n
. He is fond of performing weird operations on arrays. This time, he comes up with two types of operations:
Choose any
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and increment
a
j
by
1
for every
j
which is a multiple of
i
and
1≤j≤n
.
Choose any
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and decrement
a
j
by
1
for every
j
which is a multiple of
i
and
1≤j≤n
.
He wants to convert array
a
into an array
b
using the minimum total number of operations. However, Jeevan seems to have forgotten the value of
b
1
. So he makes some guesses. He will ask you
q
questions corresponding to his
q
guesses, the
i
-th of which is of the form:
If
b
1
=
x
i
, what is the minimum number of operations required to convert
a
to
b
?
Help him by answering each question.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
)
 — the size of arrays
a
and
b
.
The second line contains

10
6
for
i≠1
;
b
1
=−1
, representing that the value of
b
1
is unknown
)
.
The fourth line contains a single integer
q
(1≤q≤2⋅
10
5
)
 — the number of questions.
Each of the following
q
lines contains a single integer
x
i
(1≤
x
i
≤
10
6
)
 — representing the
i
-th question.
Output
Output
q
integers  — the answers to each of his
q
questions.

=1
: We need to convert
[3,7]→[1,5]
. We can perform the following operations:
