A number
a
2
is said to be the arithmetic mean of two numbers
a
1
and
a
3
, if the following condition holds:
a
1
+
a
3
=2⋅
a
2
.
We define an arithmetic mean deviation of three numbers
a
1
,
a
2
and
a
3
as follows:
d(
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
)=|
a
1
+
a
3
−2⋅
a
2
|
.
Arithmetic means a lot to Jeevan. He has three numbers
a
1
,
a
2
and
a
3
and he wants to minimize the arithmetic mean deviation
d(
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
)
. To do so, he can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
Choose
i,j
from
{1,2,3}
such that
i≠j
and increment
a
i
by
1
and decrement
a
j
by
1
Help Jeevan find out the minimum value of
d(
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
)
that can be obtained after applying the operation any number of times.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤5000)
 — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains three integers
a
1
,
a
2
and
a
3
(1≤
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
≤
10
8
)
.
Output
For each test case, output the minimum value of
d(
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
)
that can be obtained after applying the operation any number of times.

Note
Note that after applying a few operations, the values of
a
1
,
a
2
and
a
3
may become negative.
In the first test case,
4
is already the Arithmetic Mean of
3
and
5
.
d(3,4,5)=|3+5−2⋅4|=0
In the second test case, we can apply the following operation:
(2,2,6)

a

d(1,3,6)=|1+6−2⋅3|=1
It can be proven that answer can not be improved any further.
