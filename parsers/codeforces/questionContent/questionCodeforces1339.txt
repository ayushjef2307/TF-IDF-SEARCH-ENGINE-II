For two positive integers
l
and
r
(
l≤r
) let
c(l,r)
denote the number of integer pairs
(i,j)
such that
l≤i≤j≤r
and
gcd(i,j)≥l
. Here,
gcd(i,j)
is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers
i
and
j
.
YouKn0wWho has two integers
n
and
k
where
1≤k≤n
. Let
f(n,k)
denote the minimum of
∑

Help YouKn0wWho find
f(n,k)
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤3⋅
10
5
) — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤

).
Output
For each test case, print a single integer —
f(n,k)
.

Note
In the first test case, YouKn0wWho can select the sequence
[0,2,6]
. So
f(6,2)=c(1,2)+c(3,6)=3+5=8
which is the minimum possible.
