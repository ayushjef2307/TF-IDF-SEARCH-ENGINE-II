For an array
b
of
n
integers, the extreme value of this array is the minimum number of times (possibly, zero) the following operation has to be performed to make
b
non-decreasing:
Select an index
i
such that
1≤i≤|b|
, where
|b|
is the current length of
b
.
Replace
b
i
with two elements
x
and
y
such that
x
and
y
both are positive integers and
x+y=
b
i
.
This way, the array
b
changes and the next operation is performed on this modified array.
For example, if
b=[2,4,3]
and index
2
gets selected, then the possible arrays after this operation are
[2,
1
–
,
3
–
,3]
,
[2,
2
–
,
2
–
,3]
, or
[2,
3
–
,
1
–
,3]
. And consequently, for this array, this single operation is enough to make it non-decreasing:
[2,4,3]→[2,
2
–
,
2
–
,3]
.
It's easy to see that every array of positive integers can be made non-decreasing this way.
YouKn0wWho has an array
a
of
n
integers. Help him find the sum of extreme values of all nonempty subarrays of
a
modulo
998244353
. If a subarray appears in
a
multiple times, its extreme value should be counted the number of times it appears.
An array
d
is a subarray of an array
c
if
d
can be obtained from
c
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤10000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
5
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer  — the sum of extreme values of all subarrays of
a
modulo
998244353
.

Note
Let
f(l,r)
denote the extreme value of
[
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
]
.
In the first test case,
f(1,3)=3
, because YouKn0wWho can perform the following operations on the subarray
[5,4,3]
(the newly inserted elements are underlined):
[5,4,3]→[
3
–
,
2
–
,4,3]→[3,2,
2
–
,
2
–
,3]→[
1
–
,
2
–
,2,2,2,3]
;
f(1,2)=1
, because
[5,4]→[
2
–
,
3
–
,4]
;
f(2,3)=1
, because
[4,3]→[
1
–
,
3
–
,3]
;
f(1,1)=f(2,2)=f(3,3)=0
, because they are already non-decreasing.
So the total sum of extreme values of all subarrays of
a=3+1+1+0+0+0=5
.
