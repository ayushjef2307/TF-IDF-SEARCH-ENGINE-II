YouKn0wWho has an integer sequence
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. He will perform the following operation until the sequence becomes empty: select an index
i
such that
1≤i≤|a|
and
a
i
is not divisible by
(i+1)
, and erase this element from the sequence. Here
|a|
is the length of sequence
a
at the moment of operation. Note that the sequence
a
changes and the next operation is performed on this changed sequence.
For example, if
a=[3,5,4,5]
, then he can select
i=2
, because
a
2
=5
is not divisible by
i+1=3
. After this operation the sequence is
[3,4,5]
.
Help YouKn0wWho determine if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤10000
)  — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
3⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to erase the whole sequence using the aforementioned operation, print "NO" (without quotes) otherwise. You can print each letter in any register (upper or lower).

Note
In the first test case, YouKn0wWho can perform the following operations (the erased elements are underlined):
[1,
2
–
,3]→[
1
–
,3]→[
3
–
]→[].
In the second test case, it is impossible to erase the sequence as
i
can only be
1
, and when
i=1
,
a
1
=2
is divisible by
i+1=2
.
