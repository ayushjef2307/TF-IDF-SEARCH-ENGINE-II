You are given a string
s
. You need to find two non-empty strings
a
and
b
such that the following conditions are satisfied:
Strings
a
and
b
are both subsequences of
s
.
For each index
i
, character
s
i
of string
s
must belong to exactly one of strings
a
or
b
.
String
a
is lexicographically minimum possible; string
b
may be any possible string.
Given string
s
, print any valid
a
and
b
.
Reminder:
A string
a
(
b
) is a subsequence of a string
s
if
a
(
b
) can be obtained from
s
by deletion of several (possibly, zero) elements. For example, "dores", "cf", and "for" are subsequences of "codeforces", while "decor" and "fork" are not.
A string
x
is lexicographically smaller than a string
y
if and only if one of the following holds:
x
is a prefix of
y
, but
x≠y
;
in the first position where
x
and
y
differ, the string
x
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
y
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤1000
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains one string
s
(
2≤|s|≤100
where
|s|
means the length of
s
). String
s
consists of lowercase Latin letters.
Output
For each test case, print the strings
a
and
b
that satisfy the given conditions. If there are multiple answers, print any.
Example

output
Copy
c f
a aaa
b therightboiler
Note
In the first test case, there are only two choices: either
a=
f and
b=
c or
a=
c and
b=
f. And
a=
c is lexicographically smaller than
a=
f.
In the second test case, a is the only character in the string.
In the third test case, it can be proven that b is the lexicographically smallest subsequence of
s
. The second string can be of two variants; one of them is given here.
