You are given two arrays of integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
m
.
You need to insert all elements of
b
into
a
in an arbitrary way. As a result you will get an array
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
n+m
of size
n+m
.
Note that you are not allowed to change the order of elements in
a
, while you can insert elements of
b
at arbitrary positions. They can be inserted at the beginning, between any elements of
a
, or at the end. Moreover, elements of
b
can appear in the resulting array in any order.
What is the minimum possible number of inversions in the resulting array
c
? Recall that an inversion is a pair of indices
(i,j)
such that
i<j
and
c
i
>
c
j
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤
10
6
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
The third line of each test case contains
m
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
m
(
1≤
b
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
for all tests cases in one input doesn't exceed
10
6
. The sum of
m
for all tests cases doesn't exceed
10
6
as well.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible number of inversions in the resulting array
c
.
