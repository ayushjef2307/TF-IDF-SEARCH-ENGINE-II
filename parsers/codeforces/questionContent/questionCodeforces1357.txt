outputstandard output
You are given
N
points on an infinite plane with the Cartesian coordinate system on it.
N−1
points lay on one line, and one point isn't on that line. You are on point
K
at the start, and the goal is to visit every point. You can move between any two points in a straight line, and you can revisit points. What is the minimum length of the path?
Input
The first line contains two integers:
N
(
3≤N≤2∗
10
5
) - the number of points, and
K
(
1≤K≤N
) - the index of the starting point.
Each of the next
N
lines contain two integers,
A
i
,
B
i
(
−

≤
A

B

) - coordinates of the
i−th
point.
Output
The output contains one number - the shortest path to visit all given points starting from point
K
. The absolute difference between your solution and the main solution shouldn't exceed

Note
The shortest path consists of these moves:
2 -> 5
5 -> 4
4 -> 1
1 -> 3
There isn't any shorter path possible.
