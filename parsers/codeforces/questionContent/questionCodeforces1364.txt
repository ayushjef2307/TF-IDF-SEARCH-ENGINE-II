Let's call a positive integer good if there is no digit 0 in its decimal representation.
For an array of a good numbers
a
, one found out that the sum of some two neighboring elements is equal to
x
(i.e.
x=
a
i
+
a
i+1
for some
i
).
x
had turned out to be a good number as well.
Then the elements of the array
a
were written out one after another without separators into one string
s
. For example, if
a=[12,5,6,133]
, then
s=1256133
.
You are given a string
s
and a number
x
. Your task is to determine the positions in the string that correspond to the adjacent elements of the array that have sum
x
. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.
Input
The first line contains the string
s
(
2≤|s|≤5⋅
10
5
).
The second line contains an integer
x
(
2≤x<
10
200000
).
An additional constraint on the input: the answer always exists, i.e you can always select two adjacent substrings of the string
s
so that if you convert these substrings to integers, their sum is equal to
x
.
Output
In the first line, print two integers
l
1
,
r
1
, meaning that the first term of the sum (
a
i
) is in the string
s
from position
l
1
to position
r
1
.
In the second line, print two integers
l
2
,
r
2
, meaning that the second term of the sum (
a
i+1
) is in the string
s
from position
l
2
to position
r
2
.

Note
In the first example
s[1;2]=12
and
s[3;3]=5
,
12+5=17
.
In the second example
s[2;3]=54
and
s[4;6]=471
,
54+471=525
.
In the third example
s[1;1]=2
and
s[2;2]=3
,
2+3=5
.
In the fourth example
s[2;7]=218633
and
s[8;13]=757639
,
218633+757639=976272
.
