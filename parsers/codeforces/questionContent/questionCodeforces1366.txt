You are given a matrix, consisting of
n
rows and
m
columns. The rows are numbered top to bottom, the columns are numbered left to right.
Each cell of the matrix can be either free or locked.
Let's call a path in the matrix a staircase if it:
starts and ends in the free cell;
visits only free cells;
has one of the two following structures:
the second cell is
1
to the right from the first one, the third cell is
1
to the bottom from the second one, the fourth cell is
1
to the right from the third one, and so on;
the second cell is
1
to the bottom from the first one, the third cell is
1
to the right from the second one, the fourth cell is
1
to the bottom from the third one, and so on.
In particular, a path, consisting of a single cell, is considered to be a staircase.
Here are some examples of staircases:
Initially all the cells of the matrix are free.
You have to process
q
queries, each of them flips the state of a single cell. So, if a cell is currently free, it makes it locked, and if a cell is currently locked, it makes it free.
Print the number of different staircases after each query. Two staircases are considered different if there exists such a cell that appears in one path and doesn't appear in the other path.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
and
q
(
1≤n,m≤1000
;
1≤q≤
10
4
) — the sizes of the matrix and the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
x
and
y
(
1≤x≤n
;
1≤y≤m
) — the description of each query.
Output
Print
q
integers — the
i
-th value should be equal to the number of different staircases after
i
queries. Two staircases are considered different if there exists such a cell that appears in one path and doesn't appear in the other path.
