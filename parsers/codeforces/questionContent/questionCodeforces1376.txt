Theofanis really likes sequences of positive integers, thus his teacher (Yeltsa Kcir) gave him a problem about a sequence that consists of only special numbers.
Let's call a positive number special if it can be written as a sum of different non-negative powers of
n
. For example, for
n=4
number
17
is special, because it can be written as
4
0
+
4
2
=1+16=17
, but
9
is not.
Theofanis asks you to help him find the
k
-th special number if they are sorted in increasing order. Since this number may be too large, output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤
10
9
;
1≤k≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the
k
-th special number in increasing order modulo
10
9
+7
.
