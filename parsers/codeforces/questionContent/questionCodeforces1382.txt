This problem is a simplified version of D2, but it has significant differences, so read the whole statement.
Polycarp has an array of
n
(
n
is even) integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. Polycarp conceived of a positive integer
k
. After that, Polycarp began performing the following operations on the array: take an index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and reduce the number
a
i
by
k
.
After Polycarp performed some (possibly zero) number of such operations, it turned out that all numbers in the array became the same. Find the maximum
k
at which such a situation is possible, or print
−1
if such a number can be arbitrarily large.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤10
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an even integer
n
(
4≤n≤40
) (
n
is even). The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…
a
n
(
−
10
6
≤
a
i
≤
10
6
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of all
n
specified in the given test cases does not exceed
100
.
Output
For each test case output on a separate line an integer
k
(
k≥1
) — the maximum possible number that Polycarp used in operations on the array, or
−1
, if such a number can be arbitrarily large.
