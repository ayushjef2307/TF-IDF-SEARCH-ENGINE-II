Bakry got bored of solving problems related to xor, so he asked you to solve this problem for him.
You are given an array
a
of
n
integers
[
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
]
.
Let's call a subarray
a
l
,
a
l+1
,
a
l+2
,…,
a
r
good if
a
l
&
a
l+1
&
a
l+2
…&
a
r
>
a
l
⊕
a
l+1
⊕
a
l+2
…⊕
a
r
, where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation and
&
denotes the bitwise AND operation.
Find the length of the longest good subarray of
a
, or determine that no such subarray exists.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
6
) — the length of the array.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
6
) — elements of the array.
Output
Print a single integer — the length of the longest good subarray. If there are no good subarrays, print
0
.

Note
In the first case, the answer is
2
, as the whole array is good:
5&6=4>5⊕6=3
.
In the third case, the answer is
4
, and one of the longest good subarrays is
[
