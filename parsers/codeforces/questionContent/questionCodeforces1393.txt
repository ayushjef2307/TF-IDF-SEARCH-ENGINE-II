You are given an array of integers
a
of size
n
and a permutation
p
of size
n
. There are
q
queries of three types coming to you:
For given numbers
l
and
r
, calculate the sum in array
a
on the segment from
l
to
r
:
∑
i=l
r
a
i
.
You are given two numbers
v
and
x
. Let's build a directed graph from the permutation
p
: it has
n
vertices and
n
edges
i→
p
i
. Let
C
be the set of vertices that are reachable from
v
in this graph. You should add
x
to all
a
u
such that
u
is in
C
.
You are given indices
i
and
j
. You should swap
p
i
and
p
j
.
The graph corresponding to the permutation
[2,3,1,5,4]
.
Please, process all queries and print answers to queries of type
1
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the size of the array and permutation.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−
10
8
≤
a
i
≤
10
8
).
The third line contains
n
distinct integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
).
The fourth line contains a single integer
q
 — the number of queries (
1≤q≤2⋅
10
5
).
Next
q
lines contain description of queries. The
i
-th of them starts with an integer
t
i
(
1≤
t
i
≤3
) — the query type.
If
t
i
=1
, then the
i
-th line also contains two integers
l
,
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
).
If
t
i
=2
, then the
i
-th line also contains two integers
v
,
x
(
1≤v≤n
,
−
10
8
≤x≤
10
8
).
If
t
i
=3
, then the
i
-th line also contains also two integers
i
,
j
(
1≤i,j≤n
).
Output
For every first type query, print a single integer — the answer to this query.

Note
In the first example:
The graph corresponding to the initial permutation.
There are
6
queries.
The sum on the segment from
1
to
5
is
a
1
+
a
2
+
a

a
4
+
a
5
=6+9+(−5)+3+0=13
.
If we start from
1
, we can reach
{1,2,3}
. After this query
a
is:
[7,10,−4,3,0]
.

The graph corresponding to the new permutation.
If we start from

, we can reach
{1,2,3,4,5}
. After this query
a
is:
