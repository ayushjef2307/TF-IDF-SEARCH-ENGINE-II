Petya has got an interesting flower. Petya is a busy person, so he sometimes forgets to water it. You are given
n
days from Petya's live and you have to determine what happened with his flower in the end.
The flower grows as follows:
If the flower isn't watered for two days in a row, it dies.
If the flower is watered in the
i
-th day, it grows by
1
centimeter.
If the flower is watered in the
i
-th and in the
(i−1)
-th day (
i>1
), then it grows by
5
centimeters instead of
1
.
If the flower is not watered in the
i
-th day, it does not grow.
At the beginning of the
1
-st day the flower is
1
centimeter tall. What is its height after
n
days?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the only integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
a
i
=0
or
a
i
=1
). If
a
i
=1
, the flower is watered in the
i
-th day, otherwise it is not watered.
Output
For each test case print a single integer
k
— the flower's height after
n
days, or
−1
, if the flower dies.
