Ivan decided to prepare for the test on solving integer equations. He noticed that all tasks in the test have the following form:
You are given two positive integers
u
and
v
, find any pair of integers (not necessarily positive)
x
,
y
, such that:
x
u
+
y
v
=
x+y
u+v
.
+
The solution
x=0
,
y=0
is forbidden, so you should find any solution with
(x,y)≠(0,0)
.
Please help Ivan to solve some equations of this form.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
3
) — the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤
10
9
) — the parameters of the equation.
Output
For each test case print two integers
x
,
y
— a possible solution to the equation. It should be satisfied that
−
10
18
≤x,y≤
10
18
and
(x,y)≠(0,0)
.
We can show that an answer always exists. If there are multiple possible solutions you can print any.
