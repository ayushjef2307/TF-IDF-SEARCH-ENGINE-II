You are given a tree with
n
weighted vertices labeled from
1
to
n
rooted at vertex
1
. The parent of vertex
i
is
p
i
and the weight of vertex
i
is
a
i
. For convenience, define
p
1
=0
.
For two vertices
x
and
y
of the same depth
†
†
, define
f(x,y)
as follows:
Initialize
ans=0
.
While both
x
and
y
are not
0
:
ans←ans+
a
x
⋅
a
y
;
x←
p
x
;
y←
p
y
.
f(x,y)
is the value of
ans
.
You will process
q
queries. In the
i
-th query, you are given two integers
x
i
and
y
i
and you need to calculate
f(
x
i
,
y
i
)
.
†
†
The depth of vertex
v
is the number of edges on the unique simple path from the root of the tree to vertex
v
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n≤
10
5
;
1≤q≤
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
5
).
The third line contains
n−1
integers
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
<i
).
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
x
i
and
y
i
(
1≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤n
). It is guaranteed that
x
i
and
y
i
are of the same depth.
Output
Output
q
lines, the
i
-th line contains a single integer, the value of
f(
x
i
,
y
i
)
.
