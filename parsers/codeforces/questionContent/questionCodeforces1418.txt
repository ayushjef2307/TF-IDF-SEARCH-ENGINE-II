This is a harder version of the problem with bigger constraints.
Korney Korneevich dag up an array
a
of length
n
. Korney Korneevich has recently read about the operation bitwise XOR, so he wished to experiment with it. For this purpose, he decided to find all integers
x≥0
such that there exists an increasing subsequence of the array
a
, in which the bitwise XOR of numbers is equal to
x
.
It didn't take a long time for Korney Korneevich to find all such
x
, and he wants to check his result. That's why he asked you to solve this problem!
A sequence
s
is a subsequence of a sequence
b
if
s
can be obtained from
b
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
A sequence
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
m
is called increasing if
s
1
<
s
2
<…<
s
m
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
6
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤5000
) — the elements of the array
a
.
Output
In the first line print a single integer
k
— the number of found
x
values.
In the second line print
k
integers in increasing order
x

x

k
(
0≤
x

<…<
x
k
) — found

values.

In the first test case:
To get value
x=0
it is possible to choose and empty subsequence
To get value
x=2
it is possible to choose a subsequence
[2]
To get value
x=4
it is possible to choose a subsequence
[4]
To get value
x=6
it is possible to choose a subsequence
