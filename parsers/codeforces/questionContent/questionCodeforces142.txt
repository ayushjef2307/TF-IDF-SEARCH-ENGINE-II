You are given an integer
n
and an array
a
of length
n−1
whose elements are either
0
or
1
.
Let us define the value of a permutation
†
†
p
of length
m−1
(
m≤n
) by the following process.
Let
G
be a graph of
m
vertices labeled from
1
to
m
that does not contain any edges. For each
i
from
1
to
m−1
, perform the following operations:
define
u
and
v
as the (unique) vertices in the weakly connected components
‡
‡
containing vertices
p
i
and
p
i
+1
respectively with only incoming edges
††
;
in graph
G
, add a directed edge from vertex
v
to
u
if
a
p
i
=0
, otherwise add a directed edge from vertex
u
to
v
(if
a
p
i
=1
).
Note that after each step, it can be proven that each weakly connected component of
G
has a unique vertex with only incoming edges.
Then, the value of
p
is the number of incoming edges of vertex
1
of
G
.
For each
k
from
1
to
n−1
, find the sum of values of all
k!
permutations of length
k
. Since this value can be big, you are only required to compute this value under modulo
998244353
.

A permutation of length
n
is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array), and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
‡
‡
The weakly connected components of a directed graph is the same as the components of the undirected version of the graph. Formally, for directed graph
G
, define a graph
H
where for all edges
a→b
in
G
, you add an undirected edge
a↔b
in
H
. Then the weakly connected components of
G
are the components of
H
.
††
Note that a vertex that has no edges is considered to have only incoming edges.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤5⋅
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n−1
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n−1
(
a
i
is
0
or
1
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output
n−1
integers in a line, the
i
-th integer should represent the answer when
k=i
, under modulo
998244353
.

Note
Consider the first test case.
When
k=1
, there is only
1
permutation
p
.
When
p=[1]
, we will add a single edge from vertex
2
to
1
. Vertex
1
will have
1
incoming edge. So the value of
[1]
is
1
.
Therefore when
k=1
, the answer is
1
.
When
k=2
, there are
2
permutations
p
.
When
p=[1,2]
, we will add an edge from vertex
2
to
1
and an edge from
3
to
1
. Vertex
1
will have
2
incoming edges. So the value of
[1,2]
is
2
.
When
p=[2,1]
, we will add an edge from vertex
3
to
2
and an edge from
2
to
1
. Vertex
1
will have
1
incoming edge. So the value of
[2,1]
is
1
.
Therefore when
k=2
, the answer is
2+1=3
.
