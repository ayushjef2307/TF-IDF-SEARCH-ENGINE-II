XYMXYM and CQXYM will prepare
n
problems for Codeforces. The difficulty of the problem
i
will be an integer
a
i
, where
a
i
≥0
. The difficulty of the problems must satisfy
a
i
+
a
i+1
<m
(
1≤i<n
), and
a
1
+
a
n
<m
, where
m
is a fixed integer. XYMXYM wants to know how many plans of the difficulty of the problems there are modulo
998244353
.
Two plans of difficulty
a
and
b
are different only if there is an integer
i
(
1≤i≤n
) satisfying
a
i
≠
b
i
.
Input
A single line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤50000
,
1≤m≤
10
9
).
Output
Print a single integer — the number of different plans.

are:
[0,0,0]
