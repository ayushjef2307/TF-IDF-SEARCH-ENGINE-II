Because the railway system in Gensokyo is often congested, as an enthusiastic engineer, Kawasiro Nitori plans to construct more railway to ease the congestion.
There are
n
stations numbered from
1
to
n
and
m
two-way railways in Gensokyo. Every two-way railway connects two different stations and has a positive integer length
d
. No two two-way railways connect the same two stations. Besides, it is possible to travel from any station to any other using those railways. Among these
n
stations, station
1
is the main station. You can get to any station from any other station using only two-way railways.
Because of the technological limitation, Nitori can only construct one-way railways, whose length can be arbitrary positive integer. Constructing a one-way railway from station
u
will costs
w
u
units of resources, no matter where the railway ends. To ease the congestion, Nitori plans that after construction there are at least two shortest paths from station
1
to any other station, and these two shortest paths do not pass the same station except station
1
and the terminal. Besides, Nitori also does not want to change the distance of the shortest path from station
1
to any other station.
Due to various reasons, sometimes the cost of building a new railway will increase uncontrollably. There will be a total of
q
occurrences of this kind of incident, and the
i
-th event will add additional amount of
x
i
to the cost of building a new railway from the station
k
i
.
To save resources, before all incidents and after each incident, Nitori wants you to help her calculate the minimal cost of railway construction.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
, and

q
lines contains two integers
k

q+1
lines, and the
i

i−1
-th incident (especially, the
0
-th incident means no incident occurred).

Note
In the second example, Nitori can build railways as follows:
1→2
,
1→3
,
1→4
,
2→8
, and the cost is
14+14+14+4=46
.
