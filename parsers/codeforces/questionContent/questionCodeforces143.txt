For some positive integer
m
, YunQian considers an array
q
of
2m
(possibly negative) integers good, if and only if for every possible subsequence of
q
that has length
m
, the product of the
m
elements in the subsequence is equal to the sum of the
m
elements that are not in the subsequence. Formally, let
U={1,2,…,2m}
. For all sets
S⊆U
such that
|S|=m
,
∏
i∈S
q
i
=
∑
i∈U∖S

.
Define the distance between two arrays
a
and
b
both of length
k
to be
∑
i=1
k
|
a
i
−
b
i
|
.
You are given a positive integer
n
and an array
p
of
2n
integers.
Find the minimum distance between
p
and
q
over all good arrays
q
of length
2n
. It can be shown for all positive integers
n
, at least one good array exists. Note that you are not required to construct the array
q
that achieves this minimum distance.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
2n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
2n
(
|
p
i
|≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output the minimum distance between
p
and a good
q
.

Note
In the first test case, it is optimal to let
q=[6,6]
.
In the second test case, it is optimal to let
q=[2,2,2,2]
