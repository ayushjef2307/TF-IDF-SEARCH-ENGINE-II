In fact, the problems E1 and E2 do not have much in common. You should probably think of them as two separate problems.
A permutation
p
of size
n
is given. A permutation of size
n
is an array of size
n
in which each integer from
1
to
n
occurs exactly once. For example,
[1,4,3,2]
and
[4,2,1,3]
are correct permutations while
[1,2,4]
and
[1,2,2]
are not.
Let us consider an empty deque (double-ended queue). A deque is a data structure that supports adding elements to both the beginning and the end. So, if there are elements
[1,5,2]
currently in the deque, adding an element
4
to the beginning will produce the sequence
[4,1,5,2]
, and adding same element to the end will produce
[1,5,2,4]
.
The elements of the permutation are sequentially added to the initially empty deque, starting with
p
1
and finishing with
p
n
. Before adding each element to the deque, you may choose whether to add it to the beginning or the end.
For example, if we consider a permutation
p=[3,1,2,4]
, one of the possible sequences of actions looks like this:
1. add
3
to the end of the deque: deque has a sequence
[3]
in it;
2. add
1
to the beginning of the deque: deque has a sequence
[1,3]
in it;
3. add
2
to the end of the deque: deque has a sequence
[1,3,2]
in it;
4. add
4
to the end of the deque: deque has a sequence
[1,3,2,4]
in it;
Find the lexicographically smallest possible sequence of elements in the deque after the entire permutation has been processed.
A sequence
[
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
]
is lexicographically smaller than the sequence
[
y
1
,
y
2
,…,
y
n
]
if there exists such
i≤n
that
x
1
=
y
1
,
x
2
=
y
2
,
…
,
x
i−1
=
y
i−1
and
x
i
<
y
i
. In other words, if the sequences
x
and
y
have some (possibly empty) matching prefix, and the next element of the sequence
x
is strictly smaller than the corresponding element of the sequence
y
. For example, the sequence
[1,3,2,4]
is smaller than the sequence
[1,3,4,2]
because after the two matching elements
[1,3]
in the start the first sequence has an element
2
which is smaller than the corresponding element
4
in the second sequence.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The next
2t
lines contain descriptions of the test cases.
The first line of each test case description contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — permutation size. The second line of the description contains
n
space-separated integers
p
i
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
; all
p
i
are all unique) — elements of the permutation.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
Print
t
lines, each line containing the answer to the corresponding test case. The answer to a test case should contain
n
space-separated integer numbers — the elements of the lexicographically smallest permutation that is possible to find in the deque after executing the described algorithm.

Note
One of the ways to get a lexicographically smallest permutation
[1,3,2,4]
from the permutation
[3,1,2,4]
(the first sample test case) is described in the problem statement.
