You are given an array
a
of length
n
. The score of
a
is the MEX
†
†
of
[
a
1
+
a
2
,
a
2
+
a
3
,…,
a
n−1
+
a
n
]
. Find the minimum score of
a
if you are allowed to rearrange elements of
a
in any order. Note that you are not required to construct the array
a
that achieves the minimum score.
†
†
The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:
The MEX of
[2,2,1]
is
0
, because
0
does not belong to the array.
The MEX of
[3,1,0,1]
is
2
, because
0
and
1
belong to the array, but
2
does not.
The MEX of
[0,3,1,2]
is
4
because
0
,
1
,
2
, and
3
belong to the array, but
4
does not.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤2⋅
10
5
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output the minimum score of
a
after rearranging the elements of
a
in any order.

Note
In the first test case, it is optimal to rearrange
a
as
[0,0]
, the score of this array is the MEX of
[0+0]=[0]
, which is
1
.
In the second test case, it is optimal to rearrange
a
as
[0,1,0]
, the score of this array is the MEX of
[0+1,1+0]=[1,1]
, which is
0
.
