A dragon curve is a self-similar fractal curve. In this problem, it is a curve that consists of straight-line segments of the same length connected at right angles. A simple way to construct a dragon curve is as follows: take a strip of paper, fold it in half
n
times in the same direction, then partially unfold it such that the segments are joined at right angles. This is illustrated here:
In this example, a dragon curve of order
3
is constructed. In general, a dragon curve of a higher order will have a dragon curve of a lower order as its prefix. This allows us to define a dragon curve of infinite order, which is the limit of dragon curves of a finite order as the order approaches infinity.
Consider four dragon curves of infinite order. Each starts at the origin (the point
(0,0)
), and the length of each segment is
2
–
√
. The first segments of the curves end at the points
(1,1)
,
(−1,1)
,
(−1,−1)
and
(1,−1)
, respectively. The first turn of each curve is left (that is, the second segment of the first curve ends at the point
(0,2)
). In this case, every segment is a diagonal of an axis-aligned unit square with integer coordinates, and it can be proven that there is exactly one segment passing through every such square.
Given a point
(x,y)
, your task is to find on which of the four curves lies the segment passing through the square with the opposite corners at
(x,y)
and
(x+1,y+1)
, as well as the position of that segment on that curve. The curves are numbered
1
through
4
. Curve
1
goes through
(1,1)
,
2
through
(−1,1)
,
3
through
(−1,−1)
, and
4
through
(1,−1)
. The segments are numbered starting with
1
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of test cases.
Each of the following
n
lines contains two integers
x
and
y
(
−
10
9
≤x,y≤
10
9
) — the coordinates.
Output
For each test case, print a line containing two integers — the first is the index of the curve (an integer between
1
and
4
, inclusive), and the second is the position on the curve (the first segment has the position 
1
).
