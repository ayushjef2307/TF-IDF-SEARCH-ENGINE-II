Mr. Chanek's city can be represented as a plane. He wants to build a housing complex in the city.
There are some telephone poles on the plane, which is represented by a grid
a
of size
(n+1)×(m+1)
. There is a telephone pole at
(x,y)
if
a
x,y
=1
.
For each point
(x,y)
, define
S(x,y)
as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and
(x,y)
. Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points
(
x
1
,
y
1
)
and
(
x
2
,
y
2
)
is
(
x
2
−
x

)
2
+(
y

−
y
1
)
2
.
To optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all
S(x,y)
for each
0≤x≤n
and
0≤y≤m
. Help him by finding the value of
∑
n
x=0
∑
m
y=0
S(x,y)
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
0≤n,m<2000
) — the size of the grid.
Then
(n+1)
lines follow, each containing
(m+1)
integers
a
i,j
(
0≤
a
i,j
≤1
) — the grid denoting the positions of telephone poles in the plane. There is at least one telephone pole in the given grid.
Output
Output an integer denoting the value of
∑
n
x=0
∑
m
y=0
S(x,y)
.

Note
In the first example, the nearest telephone pole for the points
(0,0)
,
(1,0)
,
(2,0)
,
(0,1)
,
(1,1)
, and
(2,1)
is at
(0,0)
. While the nearest telephone pole for the points
(0,2)
,
(1,2)
, and
(2,2)
is at
(0,2)
. Thus,
∑
n
x=0
∑

y=0
S(x,y)=(0+1+4)+(1+2+5)+(0+1+4)=18
.
