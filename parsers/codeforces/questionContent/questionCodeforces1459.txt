Chanek Jones is back, helping his long-lost relative Indiana Jones, to find a secret treasure in a maze buried below a desert full of illusions.
The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with
n
rooms numbered from
1
to
n
and
n−1
tunnels connecting them such that it is possible to travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels.
The
i
-th room (
1≤i≤n
) has
a
i
illusion rate. To go from the
x
-th room to the
y
-th room, there must exist a tunnel between
x
and
y
, and it takes
max(|
a
x
+
a
y
|,|
a
x
−
a
y
|)
energy.
|z|
denotes the absolute value of
z
.
To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask
q
queries.
There are two types of queries to be done:
1 u c
— The illusion rate of the
x
-th room is changed to
c
(
1≤u≤n
,
0≤|c|≤
10
9
).
2 u v
— Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room
v
if they are initially at room
u
(
1≤u,v≤n
).
Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n≤
10
5
,
1≤q≤
10
5
) — the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤|
a
i
|≤
10
9
) — inital illusion rate of each room.
The
i
-th of the next
n−1
lines contains two integers
s
i
and
t
i
(
1≤
s
i
,
t
i
≤n
), meaning there is a tunnel connecting
s
i
-th room and
t
i
-th room. The given edges form a tree.
The next
q
lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.
Output
For each type
2
query, output a line containing an integer — the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.

Note
In the first query, their movement from the
1
-st to the
2
-nd room is as follows.
1→5
— takes
max(|10+4|,|10−4|)=14
energy.
5→6
— takes
max(|4+(−6)|,|4−(−6)|)=10
energy.
6→2
— takes
max(|−6+(−9)|,|−6−(−9)|)=15
energy.
In total, it takes
39
energy.
In the second query, the illusion rate of the
1
-st room changes from
10
to
−3
.
In the third query, their movement from the
1
-st to the
2
-nd room is as follows.
1→5
— takes
max(|−3+4|,|−3−4|)=7
energy.
5→6
— takes
max(|4+(−6)|,|4−(−6)|)=10
energy.
6→2
— takes
max(|−6+(−9)|,|−6−(−9)|)=15
energy.
Now, it takes
32
energy.
