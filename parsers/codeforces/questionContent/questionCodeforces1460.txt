The Winter holiday will be here soon. Mr. Chanek wants to decorate his house's wall with ornaments. The wall can be represented as a binary string
a
of length
n
. His favorite nephew has another binary string
b
of length
m
(
m≤n
).
Mr. Chanek's nephew loves the non-negative integer
k
. His nephew wants exactly
k
occurrences of
b
as substrings in
a
.
However, Mr. Chanek does not know the value of
k
. So, for each
k
(
0≤k≤n−m+1
), find the minimum number of elements in
a
that have to be changed such that there are exactly
k
occurrences of
b
in
a
.
A string
s
occurs exactly
k
times in
t
if there are exactly
k
different pairs
(p,q)
such that we can obtain
s
by deleting
p
characters from the beginning and
q
characters from the end of
t
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤m≤n≤500
) — size of the binary string
a
and
b
respectively.
The second line contains a binary string
a
of length
n
.
The third line contains a binary string
b
of length
m
.
Output
Output
n−m+2
integers — the
(k+1)
-th integer denotes the minimal number of elements in
a
that have to be changed so there are exactly
k
occurrences of
b
as a substring in
a
.

Note
For
k=0
, to make the string
a
have no occurrence of 101, you can do one character change as follows.
100101011
→
100100011
For
k=1
, you can also change a single character.
100101011
→
100001011
For
k=2
, no changes are needed.
