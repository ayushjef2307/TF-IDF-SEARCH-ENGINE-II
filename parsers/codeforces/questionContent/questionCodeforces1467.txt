Andi and Budi were given an assignment to tidy up their bookshelf of
n
books. Each book is represented by the book title — a string
s
i
numbered from
1
to
n
, each with length
m
. Andi really wants to sort the book lexicographically ascending, while Budi wants to sort it lexicographically descending.
Settling their fight, they decided to combine their idea and sort it asc-desc-endingly, where the odd-indexed characters will be compared ascendingly, and the even-indexed characters will be compared descendingly.
A string
a
occurs before a string
b
in asc-desc-ending order if and only if in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the following holds:
if it is an odd position, the string
a
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
;
if it is an even position, the string
a
has a letter that appears later in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n⋅m≤
10
6
).
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains a string
s
i
consisting of
m
uppercase Latin letters — the book title. The strings are pairwise distinct.
Output
Output
n
integers — the indices of the strings after they are sorted asc-desc-endingly.
