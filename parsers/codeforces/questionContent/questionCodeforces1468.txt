A subarray of array
a
from index
l
to the index
r
is the array
[
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
]
. The number of occurrences of the array
b
in the array
a
is the number of subarrays of
a
such that they are equal to
b
.
You are given
n
arrays
A
1
,
A
2
,…,
A
n
; the elements of these arrays are integers from
1
to
k
. You have to build an array
a
consisting of
m
integers from
1
to
k
in such a way that, for every given subarray
A
i
, the number of occurrences of
A
i
in the array
a
is not less than the number of occurrences of each non-empty subarray of
A
i
in
a
. Note that if
A
i
doesn't occur in
a
, and no subarray of
A
i
occurs in
a
, this condition is still met for
A
i
.
Your task is to calculate the number of different arrays
a
you can build, and print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
and
k
(
1≤n,m,k≤3⋅
10
5
) — the number of the given arrays, the desired length of the array
a
, and the upper bound on the values in the arrays.
Then
n
lines follow. The
i
-th line represents the array
A
i
. The first integer in the
i
-th line is
c
i
(
1≤
c
i
≤m
) — the number of elements in
A
i
; then,
c
i
integers from
1
to
k
follow — the elements of the array
A
i
.
Additional constraint on the input:
∑
i=1
n
c
i
≤3⋅
10
5
; i. e., the number of elements in the given arrays in total does not exceed
3⋅
10
5
.
Output
Print one integer — the number of different arrays
a
you can build, taken modulo
998244353
.
