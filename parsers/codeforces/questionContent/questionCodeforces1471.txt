Recently, Petya learned about a new game "Slay the Dragon". As the name suggests, the player will have to fight with dragons. To defeat a dragon, you have to kill it and defend your castle. To do this, the player has a squad of
n
heroes, the strength of the
i
-th hero is equal to
a
i
.
According to the rules of the game, exactly one hero should go kill the dragon, all the others will defend the castle. If the dragon's defense is equal to
x
, then you have to send a hero with a strength of at least
x
to kill it. If the dragon's attack power is
y
, then the total strength of the heroes defending the castle should be at least
y
.
The player can increase the strength of any hero by
1
for one gold coin. This operation can be done any number of times.
There are
m
dragons in the game, the
i
-th of them has defense equal to
x
i
and attack power equal to
y
i
. Petya was wondering what is the minimum number of coins he needs to spend to defeat the
i
-th dragon.
Note that the task is solved independently for each dragon (improvements are not saved).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — number of heroes.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
12
), where
a
i
is the strength of the
i
-th hero.
The third line contains a single integer
m
(
1≤m≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of dragons.
The next
m
lines contain two integers each,
x
i
and
y
i
(
1≤
x
i
≤
10
12
;1≤
y
i
≤
10
18
) — defense and attack power of the
i
-th dragon.
Output
Print
m
lines,
i
-th of which contains a single integer — the minimum number of coins that should be spent to defeat the
i
-th dragon.

Note
To defeat the first dragon, you can increase the strength of the third hero by
1
, then the strength of the heroes will be equal to
[3,6,3,3]
. To kill the dragon, you can choose the first hero.
To defeat the second dragon, you can increase the forces of the second and third heroes by
1
, then the strength of the heroes will be equal to
[3,7,3,3]
. To kill the dragon, you can choose a second hero.
To defeat the third dragon, you can increase the strength of all the heroes by
1
, then the strength of the heroes will be equal to
[4,7,3,4]
. To kill the dragon, you can choose a fourth hero.
To defeat the fourth dragon, you don't need to improve the heroes and choose a third hero to kill the dragon.
