A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters "(" and ")". A regular bracket sequence is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "1" and "+" between the original characters of the sequence. For example, bracket sequences "()()" and "(())" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "(1)+(1)" and "((1+1)+1)"), and ")(", "(" and ")" are not.
You are given an integer
n
. Your goal is to construct and print exactly
n
different regular bracket sequences of length
2n
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤50
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing one integer
n
(
1≤n≤50
).
Output
For each test case, print
n
lines, each containing a regular bracket sequence of length exactly
2n
. All bracket sequences you output for a testcase should be different (though they may repeat in different test cases). If there are multiple answers, print any of them. It can be shown that it's always possible.
