You are given two arrays
a
and
b
of length
n
. Array
a
contains each odd integer from
1
to
2n
in an arbitrary order, and array
b
contains each even integer from
1
to
2n
in an arbitrary order.
You can perform the following operation on those arrays:
choose one of the two arrays
pick an index
i
from
1
to
n−1
swap the
i
-th and the
(i+1)
-th elements of the chosen array
Compute the minimum number of operations needed to make array
a
lexicographically smaller than array
b
.
For two different arrays
x
and
y
of the same length
n
, we say that
x
is lexicographically smaller than
y
if in the first position where
x
and
y
differ, the array
x
has a smaller element than the corresponding element in
y
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
).
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the arrays.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤2n
, all
a
i
are odd and pairwise distinct) — array
a
.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤2n
, all
b
i
are even and pairwise distinct) — array
b
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer: the minimum number of operations needed to make array
a
lexicographically smaller than array
b
.
We can show that an answer always exists.

Note
In the first example, the array
a
is already lexicographically smaller than array
b
, so no operations are required.
In the second example, we can swap
5
and
3
and then swap
2
and
4
, which results in
[3,5,1]
and
[4,2,6]
. Another correct way is to swap
3
and
1
and then swap
5
and
1
, which results in
[1,5,3]
and
[2,4,6]
. Yet another correct way is to swap
4
and
6
and then swap
2
and
6
, which results in
[5,3,1]
and
[6,2,4]
.
