Kotlinforces is a web platfrom that hosts programming competitions.
The staff of Kotlinforces is asked to schedule
n
programming competitions on the next
m
days. Each competition is held in multiple stages; the regulations of the
i
-th competition state that this competition should consist of exactly
k
i
stages, and each stage, starting from the second one, should be scheduled exactly
t
i
days after the previous stage. In other words, if the first stage of the
i
-th competition is scheduled on day
x
, the second stage should be scheduled on day
x+
t
i
, the third stage — on day
x+2
t
i
, ..., the
k
i
-th stage (which is the last one) — on day
x+(
k
i
−1)
t
i
.
All
n
competitions should be scheduled in such a way that they start and finish during the next
m
days, and on any of these
m
days, at most one stage of one competition is held (two stages of different competitions should not be scheduled on the same day).
Is it possible to schedule all
n
competitions to meet these constraints?
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤5000
) — the number of competitions and the number of days, respectively.
Then
n
lines follow, each describing a competition which should be scheduled. The
i
-th line contains two integers
k
i
and
t
i
(
2≤
k
i
≤5000
;
1≤
t
i
≤2
) — the parameters of the
i
-th competition.
Output
If it is impossible to schedule all
n
competitions on the next
m
days so that there is at most one stage during each day, print -1.
Otherwise, print
n
integers. The
i
-th integer should represent the day when the first stage of the
i
-th competition is scheduled; days are numbered from
1
to
m
. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
