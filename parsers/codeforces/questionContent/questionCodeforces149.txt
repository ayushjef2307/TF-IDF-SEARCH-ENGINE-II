You are given a tree (a connected graph without cycles) with
n
vertices.
Consider a fixed integer
k
. Then, the graph
G
k
is an undirected graph with
n
vertices, where an edge between vertices
u
and
v
exists if and only if the distance between vertices
u
and
v
in the given tree is at least
k
.
For each
k
from
1
to
n
, print the number of connected components in the graph
G
k
.
Input
The first line contains the integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of vertices in the graph.
Each of the next
n−1
lines contains two integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
), denoting an edge between vertices
u
and
v
in the tree. It is guaranteed that these edges form a valid tree.
Output
Output
n
integers: the number of connected components in the graph
G
k
for each
k
from
1
to
n
.

Note
In the first example: If
k=1
, the graph has an edge between each pair of vertices, so it has one component. If
k=4
, the graph has only edges
4↔6
and
5↔6
, so the graph has
4
components.
In the second example: when
k=1
or
k=2
the graph has one component. When
k=3
the graph
G
k
splits into
3
components: one component has vertices
1
,
4
and
5
, and two more components contain one vertex each. When
k=4
or
k=5
each vertex is a separate component.
