Once upon a time, Petya had an array of integers
a
of length
n
. But over time, the array itself was lost, and only
n−1
results of comparisons of neighboring array elements remained. In other words, for every
i
from
1
to
n−1
, Petya knows exactly one of these three facts:
a
i
<
a
i+1
;
a
i
=
a
i+1
;
a
i
>
a
i+1
.
Petya wonders if it is possible to uniquely determine the result of comparing
a
1
and
a
n
.
You have to help Petya determine the result of comparing
a
1
and
a
n
or report that the result cannot be determined unambiguously.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤500
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of the test case contains the string
s
(
1≤|s|≤100
), where
s
i
is:
<, if
a
i
<
a
i+1
;
>, if
a
i
>
a
i+1
;
=, if
a
i
=
a
i+1
.
Output
For each test case, print a single string equal to:
<, if
a
1
<
a
n
;
>, if
a
1
>
a
n
;
=, if
a
1
=
a
n
;
?, if it is impossible to uniquely determine the result of the comparison.

Note
Consider the test cases of the example:
in the first test case, it's easy to see that
a
1
>
a
4
since
a
1
>
a
2
>
a
3
>
a
4
;
in the second test case, both sequences
[1,2,0,10,10,15]
and
[10,11,1,2,2,5]
meet the constraints; in the first one,
a
1
<
a
6
, and in the second one,
a
1
>
a
6
, so it's impossible to compare
a
1
and
a
6
;
in the third test case, we already know that
a
1
=
a
2
;
in the fourth test case, it's easy to see that
a
3
=
a
4
=
a
5
, and
a
1
<
a
2
<
a
3
, so
a
1
<
a
5
.
