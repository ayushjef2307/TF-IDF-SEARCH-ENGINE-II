Alice has just learned addition. However, she hasn't learned the concept of "carrying" fully — instead of carrying to the next column, she carries to the column two columns to the left.
For example, the regular way to evaluate the sum
2039+2976
would be as shown:
However, Alice evaluates it as shown:
In particular, this is what she does:
add
9
and
6
to make
15
, and carry the
1
to the column two columns to the left, i. e. to the column "
0
9
";
add
3
and
7
to make
10
and carry the
1
to the column two columns to the left, i. e. to the column "
2
2
";
add
1
,
0
, and
9
to make
10
and carry the
1
to the column two columns to the left, i. e. to the column above the plus sign;
add
1
,
2
and
2
to make
5
;
add
1
to make
1
.
Thus, she ends up with the incorrect result of
15005
.
Alice comes up to Bob and says that she has added two numbers to get a result of
n
. However, Bob knows that Alice adds in her own way. Help Bob find the number of ordered pairs of positive integers such that when Alice adds them, she will get a result of
n
. Note that pairs
(a,b)
and
(b,a)
are considered different if
a≠b
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
9
) — the number Alice shows Bob.
Output
For each test case, output one integer — the number of ordered pairs of positive integers such that when Alice adds them, she will get a result of
n
.
