Alice gave Bob two integers
a
and
b
(
a>0
and
b≥0
). Being a curious boy, Bob wrote down an array of non-negative integers with
MEX
value of all elements equal to
a
and
XOR
value of all elements equal to
b
.
What is the shortest possible length of the array Bob wrote?
Recall that the
MEX
(Minimum EXcluded) of an array is the minimum non-negative integer that does not belong to the array and the
XOR
of an array is the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the array.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤5⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(
1≤a≤3⋅
10
5
;
0≤b≤3⋅
10
5
) — the
MEX
and
XOR
of the array, respectively.
Output
For each test case, output one (positive) integer — the length of the shortest array with
MEX
a
and
XOR
b
. We can show that such an array always exists.

Note
In the first test case, one of the shortest arrays with
MEX
1
and
XOR
1
is
[0,2020,2021]
.
In the second test case, one of the shortest arrays with
MEX
2
and
XOR
1
is
[0,1]
.
It can be shown that these arrays are the shortest arrays possible.
