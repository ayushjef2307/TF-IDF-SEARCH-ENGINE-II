A binary string is a string that consists of characters
0
and
1
. A bi-table is a table that has exactly two rows of equal length, each being a binary string.
Let
MEX
of a bi-table be the smallest digit among
0
,
1
, or
2
that does not occur in the bi-table. For example,
MEX
for
[
0011
1010
]
is
2
, because
0
and
1
occur in the bi-table at least once.
MEX
for
[
111
111
]
is
0
, because
0
and
2
do not occur in the bi-table, and
0<2
.
You are given a bi-table with
n
columns. You should cut it into any number of bi-tables (each consisting of consecutive columns) so that each column is in exactly one bi-table. It is possible to cut the bi-table into a single bi-table — the whole bi-table.
What is the maximal sum of
MEX
of all resulting bi-tables can be?
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of columns in the bi-table.
Each of the next two lines contains a binary string of length
n
 — the rows of the bi-table.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print a single integer — the maximal sum of
MEX
of all bi-tables that it is possible to get by cutting the given bi-table optimally.

Note
In the first test case you can cut the bi-table as follows:
[

is
