You are given two positive integers
n
and
s
. Find the maximum possible median of an array of
n
non-negative integers (not necessarily distinct), such that the sum of its elements is equal to
s
.
A median of an array of integers of length
m
is the number standing on the
⌈
m
2
⌉
-th (rounding up) position in the non-decreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting from
1
. For example, a median of the array
[20,40,20,50,50,30]
is the
⌈
m
2
⌉
-th element of
[20,20,30,40,50,50]
, so it is
30
. There exist other definitions of the median, but in this problem we use the described definition.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
Each test case contains a single line with two integers
n
and
s
(
1≤n,s≤
10
9
) — the length of the array and the required sum of the elements.
Output
For each test case print a single integer — the maximum possible median.
