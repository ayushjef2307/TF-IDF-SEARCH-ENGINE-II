You are given two integers
l
and
r
,
l≤r
. Find the largest possible value of
amodb
over all pairs
(a,b)
of integers for which
r≥a≥b≥l
.
As a reminder,
amodb
is a remainder we get when dividing
a
by
b
. For example,
26mod8=2
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases.
The first line contains one positive integer
t
(1≤t≤
10
4
)
, denoting the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
l
,
r
(
1≤l≤r≤
10
9
).
Output
For every test case, output the largest possible value of
amodb
over all pairs
(a,b)
of integers for which
r≥a≥b≥l
.

Note
In the first test case, the only allowed pair is
(a,b)=(1,1)
, for which
amodb=1mod1=0
.
In the second test case, the optimal choice is pair
(a,b)=(1000000000,999999999)
, for which
amodb=1
.
