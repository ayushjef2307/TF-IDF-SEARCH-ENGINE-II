There is an array
a
consisting of non-negative integers. You can choose an integer
x
and denote
b
i
=
a
i
⊕x
for all
1≤i≤n
, where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation. Is it possible to choose such a number
x
that the value of the expression
b

equals
0
?
It can be shown that if a valid number
x
exists, then there also exists
x
such that (
0≤x<
2
8
).
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤1000
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of the test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
3
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of the test case contains
n
integers — array
a
(
0≤
a
i
<
2
8
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
3
.
Output
For each set test case, print the integer
x
(
0≤x<
2
8
) if it exists, or
−1
otherwise.

Note
In the first test case, after applying the operation with the number
6
the array
b
becomes
[7,4,3]
,
7⊕4⊕3=0
.
There are other answers in the third test case, such as the number
0
.
