It is a simplified version of problem F2. The difference between them is the constraints (F1:
k≤2
, F2:
k≤10
).
You are given an integer
n
. Find the minimum integer
x
such that
x≥n
and the number
x
is
k
-beautiful.
A number is called
k
-beautiful if its decimal representation having no leading zeroes contains no more than
k
different digits. E.g. if
k=2
, the numbers
3434443
,
55550
,
777
and
21
are
k
-beautiful whereas the numbers
120
,
445435
and
998244353
are not.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case consists of one line containing two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤
10
9
,
1≤k≤2
).
Output
For each test case output on a separate line
x
— the minimum
k
-beautiful integer such that
x≥n
.
