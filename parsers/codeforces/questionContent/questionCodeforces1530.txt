Mocha wants to be an astrologer. There are
n
stars which can be seen in Zhijiang, and the brightness of the
i
-th star is
a
i
.
Mocha considers that these
n
stars form a constellation, and she uses
(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
)
to show its state. A state is called mathematical if all of the following three conditions are satisfied:
For all
i
(
1≤i≤n
),
a
i
is an integer in the range
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
.
∑
i=1
n
a
i
≤m
.
gcd(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
)=1
.
Here,
gcd(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
)
denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
.
Mocha is wondering how many different mathematical states of this constellation exist. Because the answer may be large, you must find it modulo
998244353
.
Two states
(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
)
and
(
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
)
are considered different if there exists
i
(
1≤i≤n
) such that
a
i
≠
b
i
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤50
,
1≤m≤
10
5
) — the number of stars and the upper bound of the sum of the brightness of stars.
Each of the next
n
lines contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤m
) — the range of the brightness of the
i
-th star.
Output
Print a single integer — the number of different mathematical states of this constellation, modulo
998244353
.
