Raj has a single physical network line that connects his office to the Internet. This line bandwidth is
b
bytes per millisecond.
There are
n
users who would like to use this network line to transmit some data. The
i
-th of them will use the line from millisecond
s
i
to millisecond
f
i
inclusive. His initial data rate will be set to
d
i
. That means he will use data rate equal to
d
i
for millisecond
s
i
, and then it will change according to the procedure described below.
The flow control will happen as follows. Suppose there are
m
users trying to transmit some data via the given network line during millisecond
x
. Denote as
t
i
the data rate that the
i
-th of these
m
users has at the beginning of this millisecond. All
t
i
are non-negative integer values.
If
m=0
, i. e. there are no users trying to transmit data during this millisecond, nothing happens.
If the sum of all
t
i
is less than or equal to
b
, each active user successfully completes his transmission (the
i
-th active user transmits
t
i
bytes). After that, the data rate of each active user grows by
1
, i. e. each
t
i
is increased by
1
.
If the sum of all
t
i
is greater than
b
, the congestion occurs and no data transmissions succeed this millisecond at all. If that happens, each
t
i
decreases twice, i. e. each
t
i
is replaced with
⌊
t
i
2
⌋
.
Raj knows all the values
n
,
b
,
s
i
,
f
i
, and
d
i
, he wants to calculate the total number of bytes transmitted by all the users in the aggregate.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
b
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤b≤
10
9
), the number of users who will use the line and the line bandwidth, respectively.
Each of the following
n
lines contains three integers
s
i
,
f
i
and
d
i
(
1≤
s
i
≤
f
i
≤
10
9
,
1≤
d
i
≤
10
9
), denoting that the
i
-th user will try to transmit data during each millisecond between
s
i
and
f
i
inclusive, and the initial data rate of the
i
-th user.
Output
Print one integer — the total number of bytes all users will successfully transmit.

Note
Consider the first example.
Millisecond
1
: User
1
transmits
2
bytes.
Millisecond
2
: User
1
transmits
3
bytes.
Millisecond
3
: Congestion occurs, and no user transmits data.
Millisecond
4
: User
1
transmits
2
bytes.
Millisecond
5
: User
1
transmits
3
bytes.
In the second example, at each millisecond from the
7
-th to the
11
-th inclusive, congestion occurs, and the only user decreases their rate twice. However, they don't decrease the speed enough before disconnecting.
