Note that the memory limit in this problem is lower than in others.
You have a vertical strip with
n
cells, numbered consecutively from
1
to
n
from top to bottom.
You also have a token that is initially placed in cell
n
. You will move the token up until it arrives at cell
1
.
Let the token be in cell
x>1
at some moment. One shift of the token can have either of the following kinds:
Subtraction: you choose an integer
y
between
1
and
x−1
, inclusive, and move the token from cell
x
to cell
x−y
.
Floored division: you choose an integer
z
between
2
and
x
, inclusive, and move the token from cell
x
to cell
⌊
x
z
⌋
(
x
divided by
z
rounded down).
Find the number of ways to move the token from cell
n
to cell
1
using one or more shifts, and print it modulo
m
. Note that if there are several ways to move the token from one cell to another in one shift, all these ways are considered distinct (check example explanation for a better understanding).
Input
The only line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤4⋅

;
10

<m<

;
m
is a prime number) — the length of the strip and the modulo.
Output
Print the number of ways to move the token from cell
n
to cell
1
, modulo
m
.

Note
In the first test, there are three ways to move the token from cell
3
to cell
1
in one shift: using subtraction of
y=2
, or using division by
z=2
or
z=3
.
There are also two ways to move the token from cell
3
to cell
1
via cell
2
: first subtract
y=1
, and then either subtract
y=1
again or divide by
z=2
.
Therefore, there are five ways in total.
