Alice and Borys are playing tennis.
A tennis match consists of games. In each game, one of the players is serving and the other one is receiving.
Players serve in turns: after a game where Alice is serving follows a game where Borys is serving, and vice versa.
Each game ends with a victory of one of the players. If a game is won by the serving player, it's said that this player holds serve. If a game is won by the receiving player, it's said that this player breaks serve.
It is known that Alice won
a
games and Borys won
b
games during the match. It is unknown who served first and who won which games.
Find all values of
k
such that exactly
k
breaks could happen during the match between Alice and Borys in total.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
3
). Description of the test cases follows.
Each of the next
t
lines describes one test case and contains two integers
a
and
b
(
0≤a,b≤
10
5
;
a+b>0
) — the number of games won by Alice and Borys, respectively.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
a+b
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print two lines.
In the first line, print a single integer
m
 (
1≤m≤a+b+1
) — the number of values of
k
such that exactly
k
breaks could happen during the match.
In the second line, print
m
distinct integers
k

,
k
2
,…,
k
m
(
0≤
k
1
<
k
2
<…<
k
m
≤a+b
) — the sought values of
k
in increasing order.

Note
In the first test case, any number of breaks between
0
and
3
could happen during the match:
Alice holds serve, Borys holds serve, Alice holds serve:
0
breaks;
Borys holds serve, Alice holds serve, Alice breaks serve:
1
break;
Borys breaks serve, Alice breaks serve, Alice holds serve:
2
breaks;
Alice breaks serve, Borys breaks serve, Alice breaks serve:
3
breaks.
In the second test case, the players could either both hold serves (
0
breaks) or both break serves (
2
breaks).
In the third test case, either
2
or
3
breaks could happen:
Borys holds serve, Borys breaks serve, Borys holds serve, Borys breaks serve, Borys holds serve:
2
breaks;
Borys breaks serve, Borys holds serve, Borys breaks serve, Borys holds serve, Borys breaks serve:
3
breaks.
