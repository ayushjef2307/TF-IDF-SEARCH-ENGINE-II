Moamen and Ezzat are playing a game. They create an array
a
of
n
non-negative integers where every element is less than
2
k
.
Moamen wins if

&
a

&
a

&…&
a
n
≥

n
.
Here
&
denotes the bitwise AND operation, and
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Please calculate the number of winning for Moamen arrays
a
.
As the result may be very large, print the value modulo
1000000007
(
10
9
+7
).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤5
)— the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
0≤k≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
For each test case, print a single value — the number of different arrays that Moamen wins with.
Print the result modulo
1000000007
(
10
9
+7
).

Note
In the first example,
n=3
,
k=1
. As a result, all the possible arrays are
[0,0,0]
,
[0,0,1]
,
[0,1,0]
,
[1,0,0]
,
[1,1,0]
,
[0,1,1]
,
[1,0,1]
, and
[1,1,1]
.
Moamen wins in only
5
of them:
[0,0,0]
,
[1,1,0]
,
[0,1,1]
,
[1,0,1]
, and
[1,1,1]
