Ezzat has an array of
n
integers (maybe negative). He wants to split it into two non-empty subsequences
a
and
b
, such that every element from the array belongs to exactly one subsequence, and the value of
f(a)+f(b)
is the maximum possible value, where
f(x)
is the average of the subsequence
x
.
A sequence
x
is a subsequence of a sequence
y
if
x
can be obtained from
y
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
The average of a subsequence is the sum of the numbers of this subsequence divided by the size of the subsequence.
For example, the average of
[1,5,6]
is
(1+5+6)/3=12/3=4
, so
f([1,5,6])=4
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
3
)— the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(

≤
a
i
≤
10

).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
3⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single value — the maximum value that Ezzat can achieve.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
−6
.
Formally, let your answer be
a
, and the jury's answer be
b
. Your answer is accepted if and only if
|a−b|
max(1,|b|)
≤
10
−6
.

Note
In the first test case, the array is
[3,1,2]
. These are all the possible ways to split this array:
a=[3]
,
b=[1,2]
, so the value of
f(a)+f(b)=3+1.5=4.5
.
a=[3,1]
,
b=[2]
, so the value of
f(a)+f(b)=2+2=4
.
a=[3,2]
,
b=[1]
, so the value of
f(a)+f(b)=2.5+1=3.5
.
Therefore, the maximum possible value
4.5
.
In the second test case, the array is
[−7,−6,−6]
. These are all the possible ways to split this array:
a=[−7]
,
b=[−6,−6]
, so the value of
f(a)+f(b)=(−7)+(−6)=−13
.
a=[−7,−6]
,
b=[−6]
, so the value of
f(a)+f(b)=(−6.5)+(−6)=−12.5
.
Therefore, the maximum possible value
−12.5
.
