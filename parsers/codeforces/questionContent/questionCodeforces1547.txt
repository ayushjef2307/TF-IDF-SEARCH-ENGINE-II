William really likes puzzle kits. For one of his birthdays, his friends gifted him a complete undirected edge-weighted graph consisting of
n
vertices.
He wants to build a spanning tree of this graph, such that for the first
k
vertices the following condition is satisfied: the degree of a vertex with index
i
does not exceed
d
i
. Vertices from
k+1
to
n
may have any degree.
William wants you to find the minimum weight of a spanning tree that satisfies all the conditions.
A spanning tree is a subset of edges of a graph that forms a tree on all
n
vertices of the graph. The weight of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of weights of all the edges included in a spanning tree.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers
n
,
k
(
2≤n≤50
,
1≤k≤min(n−1,5)
).
The second line contains
k
integers
d
1
,
d
2
,…,
d
k
(
1≤
d
i
≤n
).
The
i
-th of the next
n−1
lines contains
n−i
integers
w
i,i+1
,
w
i,i+2
,…,
w
i,n
(
1≤
w
i,j
≤100
): weights of edges
(i,i+1),(i,i+2),…,(i,n)
.
Output
Print one integer: the minimum weight of a spanning tree under given degree constraints for the first
k
vertices.
