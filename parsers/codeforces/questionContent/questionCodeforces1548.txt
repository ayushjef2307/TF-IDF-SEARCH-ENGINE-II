As mentioned previously William really likes playing video games. In one of his favorite games, the player character is in a universe where every planet is designated by a binary number from
0
to
2
n
−1
. On each planet, there are gates that allow the player to move from planet
i
to planet
j
if the binary representations of
i
and
j
differ in exactly one bit.
William wants to test you and see how you can handle processing the following queries in this game universe:
Destroy planets with numbers from
l
to
r
inclusively. These planets cannot be moved to anymore.
Figure out if it is possible to reach planet
b
from planet
a
using some number of planetary gates. It is guaranteed that the planets
a
and
b
are not destroyed.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
,
m
(
1≤n≤50
,
1≤m≤5⋅
10
4
), which are the number of bits in binary representation of each planets' designation and the number of queries, respectively.
Each of the next
m
lines contains a query of two types:
block l r — query for destruction of planets with numbers from
l
to
r
inclusively (
0≤l≤r<
2
n
). It's guaranteed that no planet will be destroyed twice.
ask a b — query for reachability between planets
a
and
b
(
0≤a,b<
2
n
). It's guaranteed that planets
a
and
b
hasn't been destroyed yet.
Output
For each query of type ask you must output "1" in a new line, if it is possible to reach planet
b
from planet
a
and "0" otherwise (without quotation marks).

Note
The first example test can be visualized in the following way:
Response to a query ask 0 7 is positive.
Next after query block 3 6 the graph will look the following way (destroyed vertices are highlighted):
Response to a query ask 0 7 is negative, since any path from vertex
0
to vertex
7
must go through one of the destroyed vertices.
