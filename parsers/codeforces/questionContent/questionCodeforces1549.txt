William is not only interested in trading but also in betting on sports matches.
n
teams participate in each match. Each team is characterized by strength
a
i
. Each two teams
i<j
play with each other exactly once. Team
i
wins with probability
a
i
a
i
+
a
j
and team
j
wins with probability
a
j
a
i
+
a
j
.
The team is called a winner if it directly or indirectly defeated all other teams. Team
a
defeated (directly or indirectly) team
b
if there is a sequence of teams
c
1
,
c
2
, ...
c
k
such that
c
1
=a
,
c
k
=b
and team
c
i
defeated team
c
i+1
for all
i
from
1
to
k−1
. Note that it is possible that team
a
defeated team
b
and in the same time team
b
defeated team
a
.
William wants you to find the expected value of the number of winners.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤14
), which is the total number of teams participating in a match.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
6
)  — the strengths of teams participating in a match.
Output
Output a single integer  — the expected value of the number of winners of the tournament modulo
10
9
+7
.
Formally, let
M=
10
9
+7
. It can be demonstrated that the answer can be presented as a irreducible fraction
p
q
, where
p
and
q
are integers and
q≢0(modM)
. Output a single integer equal to
p⋅
q
−1
modM
. In other words, output an integer
x
such that
0≤x<M
and
x⋅q≡p(modM)
.

Note
To better understand in which situation several winners are possible let's examine the second test:
One possible result of the tournament is as follows (
a→b
means that
a
defeated
b
):
1→2
2→3
3→1
1→4
1→5
2→4
2→5
3→4
3→5
4→5
Or more clearly in the picture:
In this case every team from the set
{1,2,3}
directly or indirectly defeated everyone. I.e.:
1
st defeated everyone because they can get to everyone else in the following way
1→2
,
1→2→3
,
1→4
,
1→5
.
2
nd defeated everyone because they can get to everyone else in the following way
2→3
,
2→3→1
,
2→4
,
2→5
.
3
rd defeated everyone because they can get to everyone else in the following way
3→1
,
3→1→2
,
3→4
,
3→5
.
Therefore the total number of winners is
3
.
