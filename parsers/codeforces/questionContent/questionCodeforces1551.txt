This is an interactive task
William has a certain sequence of integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
in his mind, but due to security concerns, he does not want to reveal it to you completely. William is ready to respond to no more than
2⋅n
of the following questions:
What is the result of a bitwise AND of two items with indices
i
and
j
(
i≠j
)
What is the result of a bitwise OR of two items with indices
i
and
j
(
i≠j
)
You can ask William these questions and you need to find the
k
-th smallest number of the sequence.
Formally the
k
-th smallest number is equal to the number at the
k
-th place in a 1-indexed array sorted in non-decreasing order. For example in array
[5,3,3,10,1]
4
th smallest number is equal to
5
, and
2
nd and
3
rd are
3
.
Input
It is guaranteed that for each element in a sequence the condition
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
is satisfied.
Interaction
In the first line you will be given two integers
n
and
k
(3≤n≤
10
4
,1≤k≤n)
, which are the number of items in the sequence
a
and the number
k
.
After that, you can ask no more than
2⋅n
questions (not including the "finish" operation).
Each line of your output may be of one of the following types:
"or i j"
(1≤i,j≤n,i≠j)
, where
i
and
j
are indices of items for which you want to calculate the bitwise OR.
"and i j"
(1≤i,j≤n,i≠j)
, where
i
and
j
are indices of items for which you want to calculate the bitwise AND.
"finish res", where
res
is the
k
th smallest number in the sequence. After outputting this line the program execution must conclude.
In response to the first two types of queries, you will get an integer
x
, the result of the operation for the numbers you have selected.
After outputting a line do not forget to output a new line character and flush the output buffer. Otherwise you will get the "Idleness limit exceeded". To flush the buffer use:
fflush(stdout) in C++
System.out.flush() in Java
stdout.flush() in Python
flush(output) in Pascal
for other languages refer to documentation
If you perform an incorrect query the response will be
−1
. After receiving response
−1
you must immediately halt your program in order to receive an "Incorrect answer" verdict.
Hacking
To perform a hack you will need to use the following format:
The first line must contain two integers
n
and
k
(3≤n≤
10
4
,1≤k≤n)
, which are the number of items in the sequence
a
and the number
k
.
The second line must contain
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
)
, the sequence
a
.
Example

and 2 5

or 5 6

finish 5
Note
In the example, the hidden sequence is
[1,6,4,2,3,5,4]
.
Below is the interaction in the example.
Query (contestant's program) Response (interactor) Notes
and 2 5 2
a
2
=6
,
a
5
=3
. Interactor returns bitwise AND of the given numbers.
or 5 6 7
a
5
=3
,
a
6
=5
. Interactor returns bitwise OR of the given numbers.
finish 5
5
is the correct answer. Note that you must find the value and not the index of the kth smallest number.
