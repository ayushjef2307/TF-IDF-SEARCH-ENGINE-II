You are given
n
segments on a number line, numbered from
1
to
n
. The
i
-th segments covers all integer points from
l
i
to
r
i
and has a value
w
i
.
You are asked to select a subset of these segments (possibly, all of them). Once the subset is selected, it's possible to travel between two integer points if there exists a selected segment that covers both of them. A subset is good if it's possible to reach point
m
starting from point
1
in arbitrary number of moves.
The cost of the subset is the difference between the maximum and the minimum values of segments in it. Find the minimum cost of a good subset.
In every test there exists at least one good subset.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤3⋅
10
5
;
2≤m≤
10
6
) — the number of segments and the number of integer points.
Each of the next
n
lines contains three integers
l
i
,
r
i
and
w
i
(
1≤
l
i
<
r
i
≤m
;
1≤
w
i
≤
10
6
) — the description of the
i
-th segment.
In every test there exists at least one good subset.
Output
Print a single integer — the minimum cost of a good subset.
