PizzaForces is Petya's favorite pizzeria. PizzaForces makes and sells pizzas of three sizes: small pizzas consist of
6
slices, medium ones consist of
8
slices, and large pizzas consist of
10
slices each. Baking them takes
15
,
20
and
25
minutes, respectively.
Petya's birthday is today, and
n
of his friends will come, so he decided to make an order from his favorite pizzeria. Petya wants to order so much pizza that each of his friends gets at least one slice of pizza. The cooking time of the order is the total baking time of all the pizzas in the order.
Your task is to determine the minimum number of minutes that is needed to make pizzas containing at least
n
slices in total. For example:
if
12
friends come to Petya's birthday, he has to order pizzas containing at least
12
slices in total. He can order two small pizzas, containing exactly
12
slices, and the time to bake them is
30
minutes;
if
15
friends come to Petya's birthday, he has to order pizzas containing at least
15
slices in total. He can order a small pizza and a large pizza, containing
16
slices, and the time to bake them is
40
minutes;
if
300
friends come to Petya's birthday, he has to order pizzas containing at least
300
slices in total. He can order
15
small pizzas,
10
medium pizzas and
13
large pizzas, in total they contain
15⋅6+10⋅8+13⋅10=300
slices, and the total time to bake them is
15⋅15+10⋅20+13⋅25=750
minutes;
if only one friend comes to Petya's birthday, he can order a small pizza, and the time to bake it is
15
minutes.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(

Each testcase consists of a single line that contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
16
) — the number of Petya's friends.
Output
For each testcase, print one integer — the minimum number of minutes that is needed to bake pizzas containing at least
