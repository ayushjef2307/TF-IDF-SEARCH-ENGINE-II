You are given a tree with
n
nodes. As a reminder, a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.
Let
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
be a sequence of integers. Perform the following operation exactly
n
times:
Select an unerased node
u
. Assign
a
u
:=
number of unerased nodes adjacent to
u
. Then, erase the node
u
along with all edges that have it as an endpoint.
For each integer
k
from
1
to
n
, find the number, modulo
998244353
, of different sequences
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
that satisfy the following conditions:
it is possible to obtain
a
by performing the aforementioned operations exactly
n
times in some order.
gcd(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
)=k
. Here,
gcd
means the greatest common divisor of the elements in
a
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤10000
)  — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
).
Each of the next
n−1
lines contains two integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
) indicating there is an edge between vertices
u
and
v
. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
3⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print
n
integers in a single line, where for each
k
from
1
to
n
, the
k
-th integer denotes the answer when
gcd
equals to
k
.

Note
In the first test case,
If we delete the nodes in order
1→2→3
or
1→3→2
, then the obtained sequence will be
a=[2,0,0]
which has
gcd
equals to
2
.
If we delete the nodes in order
2→1→3
, then the obtained sequence will be
a=[1,1,0]
which has
gcd
equals to
1
.
If we delete the nodes in order
3→1→2
, then the obtained sequence will be
a=[1,0,1]
which has
gcd
equals to
1
.
If we delete the nodes in order
2→3→1
or
3→2→1
, then the obtained sequence will be
a=[0,1,1]
which has
gcd
equals to
1
.
Note that here we are counting the number of different sequences, not the number of different orders of deleting nodes.
