You are given two integers
n
and
m
. Find the
MEX
of the sequence
n⊕0,n⊕1,…,n⊕m
. Here,
⊕
is the bitwise XOR operator.
MEX
of the sequence of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer that doesn't appear in this sequence. For example,
MEX(0,1,2,4)=3
, and
MEX(1,2021)=0
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤30000
)  — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
0≤n,m≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, print a single integer  — the answer to the problem.

Note
In the first test case, the sequence is
3⊕0,3⊕1,3⊕2,3⊕3,3⊕4,3⊕5
, or
3,2,1,0,7,6
. The smallest non-negative integer which isn't present in the sequence i. e. the
MEX
of the sequence is
4
.
In the second test case, the sequence is
4⊕0,4⊕1,4⊕2,4⊕3,4⊕4,4⊕5,4⊕6
, or
4,5,6,7,0,1,2
. The smallest non-negative integer which isn't present in the sequence i. e. the
MEX
of the sequence is
3
.
In the third test case, the sequence is
3⊕0,3⊕1,3⊕2
, or
3,2,1
. The smallest non-negative integer which isn't present in the sequence i. e. the
MEX
of the sequence is
0
.
