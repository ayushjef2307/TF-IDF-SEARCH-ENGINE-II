For a permutation
p
of numbers
1
through
n
, we define a stair array
a
as follows:
a
i
is length of the longest segment of permutation which contains position
i
and is made of consecutive values in sorted order:
[x,x+1,…,y−1,y]
or
[y,y−1,…,x+1,x]
for some
x≤y
. For example, for permutation
p=[4,1,2,3,7,6,5]
we have
a=[1,3,3,3,3,3,3]
.
You are given the stair array
a
. Your task is to calculate the number of permutations which have stair array equal to
a
. Since the number can be big, compute it modulo
998244353
. Note that this number can be equal to zero.
Input
The first line of input contains integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
)  — the length of a stair array
a
.
The second line of input contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
).
Output
Print the number of permutations which have stair array equal to
a
. Since the number can be big, compute it modulo
998244353
.
