You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
distinct elements and an integer
k
. Each element in the array is a non-negative integer not exceeding
2
k
−1
.
Let's define the XOR distance for a number
x
as the value of
f(x)=
min
i=1
n
min
j=i+1
n
|(
a
i
⊕x)−(
a

⊕x)|,
n
n
where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
For every integer
x
from
0
to
2
k
−1
, you have to calculate
f(x)
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤19
;
2≤n≤
2
k
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a

,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
2
k
−1
). All these integers are distinct.
Output
Print
2
k
integers. The
i
-th of them should be equal to
f(i−1)
.

Note
Consider the first example:
for
x=0
, if we apply bitwise XOR to the elements of the array with
x
, we get the array
[6,0,3]
, and the minimum absolute difference of two elements is
3
;
for
x=1
, if we apply bitwise XOR to the elements of the array with
x
, we get the array
[7,1,2]
, and the minimum absolute difference of two elements is
1
;
for
x=2
, if we apply bitwise XOR to the elements of the array with
x
, we get the array
[4,2,1]
, and the minimum absolute difference of two elements is
1
;
for
x=3
, if we apply bitwise XOR to the elements of the array with
x
, we get the array
[5,3,0]
, and the minimum absolute difference of two elements is
2
;
for
x=4
, if we apply bitwise XOR to the elements of the array with
x
, we get the array
[2,4,7]
, and the minimum absolute difference of two elements is
2
;
for
x=5
, if we apply bitwise XOR to the elements of the array with
x
, we get the array
[3,5,6]
, and the minimum absolute difference of two elements is
1
;
for
x=6
, if we apply bitwise XOR to the elements of the array with
x
, we get the array
[0,6,5]
, and the minimum absolute difference of two elements is
1
;
for
x=7
, if we apply bitwise XOR to the elements of the array with
x
, we get the array
[1,7,4]
, and the minimum absolute difference of two elements is
