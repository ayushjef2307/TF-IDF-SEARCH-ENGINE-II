An ant moves on the real line with constant speed of
1
unit per second. It starts at
0
and always moves to the right (so its position increases by
1
each second).
There are
n
portals, the
i
-th of which is located at position
x
i
and teleports to position
y
i
<
x
i
. Each portal can be either active or inactive. The initial state of the
i
-th portal is determined by
s
i
: if
s
i
=0
then the
i
-th portal is initially inactive, if
s
i
=1
then the
i
-th portal is initially active. When the ant travels through a portal (i.e., when its position coincides with the position of a portal):
if the portal is inactive, it becomes active (in this case the path of the ant is not affected);
if the portal is active, it becomes inactive and the ant is instantly teleported to the position
y
i
, where it keeps on moving as normal.
How long (from the instant it starts moving) does it take for the ant to reach the position
x
n
+1
? It can be shown that this happens in a finite amount of time. Since the answer may be very large, compute it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains the integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of portals.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains three integers
x
i
,
y
i
and
s
i
(
1≤
y
i
<
x
i
≤
10
9
,
s
i
∈{0,1}
) — the position of the
i
-th portal, the position where the ant is teleported when it travels through the
i
-th portal (if it is active), and the initial state of the
i
-th portal.
The positions of the portals are strictly increasing, that is
x
1
<
x
2
<⋯<
x
n
. It is guaranteed that the
2n
integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
,
y
1
,
y
2
,…,
y
n
are all distinct.
Output
Output the amount of time elapsed, in seconds, from the instant the ant starts moving to the instant it reaches the position
x
n
+1
. Since the answer may be very large, output it modulo
998244353
.

Note
Explanation of the first sample: The ant moves as follows (a curvy arrow denotes a teleporting, a straight arrow denotes normal movement with speed
1
and the time spent during the movement is written above the arrow).
