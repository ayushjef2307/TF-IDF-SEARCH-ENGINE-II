The numbers
1,2,…,n⋅k
are colored with
n
colors. These colors are indexed by
1,2,…,n
. For each
1≤i≤n
, there are exactly
k
numbers colored with color
i
.
Let
[a,b]
denote the interval of integers between
a
and
b
inclusive, that is, the set
{a,a+1,…,b}
. You must choose
n
intervals
[
a
1
,
b
1
],[
a
2
,
b
2
],…,[
a
n
,
b
n
]
such that:
for each
1≤i≤n
, it holds
1≤
a
i
<
b
i
≤n⋅k
;
for each
1≤i≤n
, the numbers
a
i
and
b
i
are colored with color
i
;
each number
1≤x≤n⋅k
belongs to at most
⌈
n
k−1
⌉
intervals.
One can show that such a family of intervals always exists under the given constraints.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤100
,
2≤k≤100
) — the number of colors and the number of occurrences of each color.
The second line contains
n⋅k
integers
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
nk
(
1≤
c
j
≤n
), where
c
j
is the color of number
j
. It is guaranteed that, for each
1≤i≤n
, it holds
c
j
=i
for exactly
k
distinct indices
j
.
Output
Output
n
lines. The
i
-th line should contain the two integers
a
i
and
b
i
.
If there are multiple valid choices of the intervals, output any.

Note
In the first sample, each number can be contained in at most
⌈
4
3−1
⌉=2
intervals. The output is described by the following picture:
In the second sample, the only interval to be chosen is forced to be
[1,2]
, and each number is indeed contained in at most
⌈
1
2−1
⌉=1
interval.
In the third sample, each number can be contained in at most
⌈
3
3−1
⌉=2
intervals. The output is described by the following picture:
