A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.
You are given a tree of
n
vertices. Find the number of ways to choose exactly
k
vertices in this tree (i. e. a
k
-element subset of vertices) so that all pairwise distances between the selected vertices are equal (in other words, there exists an integer
c
such that for all
u,v
(
u≠v
,
u,v
are in selected vertices)
d
u,v
=c
, where
d
u,v
is the distance from
u
to
v
).
Since the answer may be very large, you need to output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤10
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case is preceded by an empty line.
Each test case consists of several lines. The first line of the test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤k≤n≤100
) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of vertices to be selected, respectively. Then
n−1
lines follow, each of them contains two integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
,
u≠v
) which describe a pair of vertices connected by an edge. It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree and has no loops or multiple edges.
Output
For each test case output in a separate line a single integer — the number of ways to select exactly
k
vertices so that for all pairs of selected vertices the distances between the vertices in the pairs are equal, modulo
10
9
+7
(in other words, print the remainder when divided by
1000000007
).
