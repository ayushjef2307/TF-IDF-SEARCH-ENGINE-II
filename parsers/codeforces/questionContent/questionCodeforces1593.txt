You are given a string
s
of length
n
. Each character is either one of the first
k
lowercase Latin letters or a question mark.
You are asked to replace every question mark with one of the first
k
lowercase Latin letters in such a way that the following value is maximized.
Let
f
i
be the maximum length substring of string
s
, which consists entirely of the
i
-th Latin letter. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string. If the
i
-th letter doesn't appear in a string, then
f
i
is equal to
0
.
The value of a string
s
is the minimum value among
f
i
for all
i
from
1
to
k
.
What is the maximum value the string can have?
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;
1≤k≤17
) — the length of the string and the number of first Latin letters used.
The second line contains a string
s
, consisting of
n
characters. Each character is either one of the first
k
lowercase Latin letters or a question mark.
Output
Print a single integer — the maximum value of the string after every question mark is replaced with one of the first
k
lowercase Latin letters.

Note
In the first example the question marks can be replaced in the following way: "aaaababbbb".
f
1
=4
,
f
2
=4
, thus the answer is
4
. Replacing it like this is also possible: "aaaabbbbbb". That way
f
1
=4
,
f
2
=6
, however, the minimum of them is still
4
.
In the second example one of the possible strings is "aabbccdda".
In the third example at least one letter won't appear in the string, thus, the minimum of values
f
i
is always
0
.
