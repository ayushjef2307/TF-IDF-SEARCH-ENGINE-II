Let's call an array
a
consisting of
n
positive (greater than
0
) integers beautiful if the following condition is held for every
i
from
1
to
n
: either
a
i
=1
, or at least one of the numbers
a
i
−1
and
a
i
−2
exists in the array as well.
For example:
the array
[5,3,1]
is beautiful: for
a
1
, the number
a
1
−2=3
exists in the array; for
a
2
, the number
a
2
−2=1
exists in the array; for
a
3
, the condition
a
3
=1
holds;
the array
[1,2,2,2,2]
is beautiful: for
a
1
, the condition
a
1
=1
holds; for every other number
a
i
, the number
a
i
−1=1
exists in the array;
the array
[1,4]
is not beautiful: for
a
2
, neither
a
2
−2=2
nor
a
2
−1=3
exists in the array, and
a
2
≠1
;
the array
[2]
is not beautiful: for
a
1
, neither
a
1
−1=1
nor
a
1
−2=0
exists in the array, and
a
1
≠1
;
the array
[2,1,3]
is beautiful: for
a
1
, the number
a
1
−1=1
exists in the array; for
a
2
, the condition
a
2
=1
holds; for
a
3
, the number
a
3
−2=1
exists in the array.
You are given a positive integer
s
. Find the minimum possible size of a beautiful array with the sum of elements equal to
s
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤5000
) — the number of test cases.
Then
t
lines follow, the
i
-th line contains one integer
s
(
1≤s≤5000
) for the
i
-th test case.
Output
Print
t
integers, the
i
-th integer should be the answer for the
i
-th testcase: the minimum possible size of a beautiful array with the sum of elements equal to
s
.

Note
Consider the example test:
in the first test case, the array
[1]
meets all conditions;
in the second test case, the array
[3,4,1]
meets all conditions;
in the third test case, the array
[1,2,4]
meets all conditions;
in the fourth test case, the array
[1,4,6,8,10,2,11]
meets all conditions.
