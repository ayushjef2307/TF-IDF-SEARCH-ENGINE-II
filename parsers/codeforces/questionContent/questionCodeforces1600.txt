Two painters, Amin and Benj, are repainting Gregor's living room ceiling! The ceiling can be modeled as an
n×m
grid.
For each
i
between
1
and
n
, inclusive, painter Amin applies
a
i
layers of paint to the entire
i
-th row. For each
j
between
1
and
m
, inclusive, painter Benj applies
b
j
layers of paint to the entire
j
-th column. Therefore, the cell
(i,j)
ends up with
a
i
+
b
j
layers of paint.
Gregor considers the cell
(i,j)
to be badly painted if
a
i
+
b
j
≤x
. Define a badly painted region to be a maximal connected component of badly painted cells, i. e. a connected component of badly painted cells such that all adjacent to the component cells are not badly painted. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share a side.
Gregor is appalled by the state of the finished ceiling, and wants to know the number of badly painted regions.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
and
x
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤x≤2⋅

) — the dimensions of Gregor's ceiling, and the maximum number of paint layers in a badly painted cell.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i

Note
The diagram below represents the first example. The numbers to the left of each row represent the list
a
, and the numbers above each column represent the list
b
. The numbers inside each cell represent the number of paint layers in that cell.
The colored cells correspond to badly painted cells. The red and blue cells respectively form
2
badly painted regions.
