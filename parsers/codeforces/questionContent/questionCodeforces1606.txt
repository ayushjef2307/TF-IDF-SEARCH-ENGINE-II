You are given a directed graph
G
which can contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). Multi-edges are absent in
G
which means that for all ordered pairs
(u,v)
exists at most one edge from
u
to
v
. Vertices are numbered from
1
to
n
.
A path from
u
to
v
is a sequence of edges such that:
vertex
u
is the start of the first edge in the path;
vertex
v
is the end of the last edge in the path;
for all pairs of adjacent edges next edge starts at the vertex that the previous edge ends on.
We will assume that the empty sequence of edges is a path from
u
to
u
.
For each vertex
v
output one of four values:
0
, if there are no paths from
1
to
v
;
1
, if there is only one path from
1
to
v
;
2
, if there is more than one path from
1
to
v
and the number of paths is finite;
−1
, if the number of paths from
1
to
v
is infinite.
Let's look at the example shown in the figure.
Then:
the answer for vertex
1
is
1
: there is only one path from
1
to
1
(path with length
0
);
the answer for vertex
2
is
0
: there are no paths from
1
to
2
;
the answer for vertex
3
is
1
: there is only one path from
1
to
3
(it is the edge
(1,3)
);
the answer for vertex
4
is
2
: there are more than one paths from
1
to
4
and the number of paths are finite (two paths:
[(1,3),(3,4)]
and
[(1,4)]
);
the answer for vertex
5
is
−1
: the number of paths from
1
to
5
is infinite (the loop can be used in a path many times);
the answer for vertex
6
is
−1
: the number of paths from
1
to
6
is infinite (the loop can be used in a path many times).
Input
The first contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases in the input. Then
t
test cases follow. Before each test case, there is an empty line.
The first line of the test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤4⋅
10
5
,0≤m≤4⋅
10
5
) — numbers of vertices and edges in graph respectively. The next
m
lines contain edges descriptions. Each line contains two integers
a
i
,
b
i
(
1≤
a
i
,
b
i
≤n
) — the start and the end of the
i
-th edge. The vertices of the graph are numbered from
1
to
n
. The given graph can contain loops (it is possible that
a
i
=
b
i
), but cannot contain multi-edges (it is not possible that
a
i
=
a
j
and
b
i
=
b
j
for
i≠j
).
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
4⋅
10
5
. Similarly, the sum of
m
over all test cases does not exceed
4⋅
10
5
.
Output
Output
t
lines. The
i
-th line should contain an answer for the
i
-th test case: a sequence of
n
integers from
−1
to
2
.
