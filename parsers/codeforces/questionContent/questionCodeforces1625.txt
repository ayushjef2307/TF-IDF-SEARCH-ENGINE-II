After defeating a Blacklist Rival, you get a chance to draw
1
reward slip out of
x
hidden valid slips. Initially,
x=3
and these hidden valid slips are Cash Slip, Impound Strike Release Marker and Pink Slip of Rival's Car. Initially, the probability of drawing these in a random guess are
c
,
m
, and
p
, respectively. There is also a volatility factor
v
. You can play any number of Rival Races as long as you don't draw a Pink Slip. Assume that you win each race and get a chance to draw a reward slip. In each draw, you draw one of the
x
valid items with their respective probabilities. Suppose you draw a particular item and its probability of drawing before the draw was
a
. Then,
If the item was a Pink Slip, the quest is over, and you will not play any more races.
Otherwise,
If
a≤v
, the probability of the item drawn becomes
0
and the item is no longer a valid item for all the further draws, reducing
x
by
1
. Moreover, the reduced probability
a
is distributed equally among the other remaining valid items.
If
a>v
, the probability of the item drawn reduces by
v
and the reduced probability is distributed equally among the other valid items.
For example,
If
(c,m,p)=(0.2,0.1,0.7)
and
v=0.1
, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be
(0.1,0.15,0.75)
.
If
(c,m,p)=(0.1,0.2,0.7)
and
v=0.2
, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be
(Invalid,0.25,0.75)
.
If
(c,m,p)=(0.2,Invalid,0.8)
and
v=0.1
, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be
(0.1,Invalid,0.9)
.
If
(c,m,p)=(0.1,Invalid,0.9)
and
v=0.2
, after drawing Cash, the new probabilities will be
(Invalid,Invalid,1.0)
.
You need the cars of Rivals. So, you need to find the expected number of races that you must play in order to draw a pink slip.
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤10
)  — the number of test cases.
The first and the only line of each test case contains four real numbers
c
,
m
,
p
and
v
(
0<c,m,p<1
,
c+m+p=1
,
0.1≤v≤0.9
).
Additionally, it is guaranteed that each of
c
,
m
,
p
and
v
have at most
4
decimal places.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing a single real number — the expected number of races that you must play in order to draw a Pink Slip.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
−6
.
Formally, let your answer be
a
, and the jury's answer be
b
. Your answer is accepted if and only if
|a−b|
max(1,|b|)
≤
10
−6
.

Note
For the first test case, the possible drawing sequences are:
P with a probability of
0.6
;
CP with a probability of
0.2⋅0.7=0.14
;
CMP with a probability of
0.2⋅0.3⋅0.9=0.054
;
CMMP with a probability of
0.2⋅0.3⋅0.1⋅1=0.006
;
MP with a probability of
0.2⋅0.7=0.14
;
MCP with a probability of
0.2⋅0.3⋅0.9=0.054
;
MCCP with a probability of
0.2⋅0.3⋅0.1⋅1=0.006
.
So, the expected number of races is equal to
1⋅0.6+2⋅0.14+3⋅0.054+4⋅0.006+2⋅0.14+3⋅0.054+4⋅0.006=1.532
.
For the second test case, the possible drawing sequences are:
P with a probability of
0.4
;
CP with a probability of
0.4⋅0.6=0.24
;
CMP with a probability of
0.4⋅0.4⋅1=0.16
;
MP with a probability of
0.2⋅0.5=0.1
;
MCP with a probability of
0.2⋅0.5⋅1=0.1
.
So, the expected number of races is equal to
1⋅0.4+2⋅0.24+3⋅0.16+2⋅0.1+3⋅0.1=1.86
.
