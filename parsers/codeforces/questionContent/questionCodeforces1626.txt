Highway 201 is the most busy street in Rockport. Traffic cars cause a lot of hindrances to races, especially when there are a lot of them. The track which passes through this highway can be divided into
n
sub-tracks. You are given an array
a
where
a
i
represents the number of traffic cars in the
i
-th sub-track. You define the inconvenience of the track as
∑
i=1
n
∑
j=i+1
n
|
a
i
−
a
j
|
, where
|x|
is the absolute value of
x
.
You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: choose a traffic car and move it from its current sub-track to any other sub-track.
Find the minimum inconvenience you can achieve.
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤10000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer: the minimum inconvenience you can achieve by applying the given operation any (possibly zero) number of times.

Note
For the first test case, you can move a car from the
3
-rd sub-track to the
1
-st sub-track to obtain
0
inconvenience.
For the second test case, moving any car won't decrease the inconvenience of the track.
