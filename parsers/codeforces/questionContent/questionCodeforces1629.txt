This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the easy version and the hard version is the constraints on
n
. You can only make hacks if both versions are solved.
A permutation of
1,2,…,n
is a sequence of
n
integers, where each integer from
1
to
n
appears exactly once. For example,
[2,3,1,4]
is a permutation of
1,2,3,4
, but
[1,4,2,2]
isn't because
2
appears twice in it.
Recall that the number of inversions in a permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
is the number of pairs of indices
(i,j)
such that
i<j
and
a
i
>
a
j
.
Let
p
and
q
be two permutations of
1,2,…,n
. Find the number of permutation pairs
(p,q)
that satisfy the following conditions:
p
is lexicographically smaller than
q
.
the number of inversions in
p
is greater than the number of inversions in
q
.
Print the number of such pairs modulo
mod
. Note that
mod
may not be a prime.
Input
The only line contains two integers
n
and
mod
(
1≤n≤50
,
1≤mod≤
10
9
).
Output
Print one integer, which is the answer modulo
mod
.
