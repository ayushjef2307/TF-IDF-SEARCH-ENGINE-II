There is an infinite set generated as follows:
1
is in this set.
If
x
is in this set,
x⋅a
and
x+b
both are in this set.
For example, when
a=3
and
b=6
, the five smallest elements of the set are:
1
,
3
(
1
is in this set, so
1⋅a=3
is in this set),
7
(
1
is in this set, so
1+b=7
is in this set),
9
(
3
is in this set, so
3⋅a=9
is in this set),
13
(
7
is in this set, so
7+b=13
is in this set).
Given positive integers
a
,
b
,
n
, determine if
n
is in this set.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line describing each test case contains three integers
n
,
a
,
b
(
1≤n,a,b≤
10
9
) separated by a single space.
Output
For each test case, print "Yes" if
n
is in this set, and "No" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.

Note
In the first test case,
24
is generated as follows:
1
is in this set, so
3
and
6
are in this set;
3
is in this set, so
9
and
8
are in this set;
8
is in this set, so
24
and
13
are in this set.
Thus we can see
24
is in this set.
The five smallest elements of the set in the second test case is described in statements. We can see that
10
isn't among them.
