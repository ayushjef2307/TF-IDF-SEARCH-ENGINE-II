This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version
q=1
. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
There is a process that takes place on arrays
a
and
b
of length
n
and length
n−1
respectively.
The process is an infinite sequence of operations. Each operation is as follows:
First, choose a random integer
i
(
1≤i≤n−1
).
Then, simultaneously set
a
i
=min(
a
i
,
a
i
+
a
i+1
−
b
i
2
)
and
a
i+1
=max(
a
i+1
,
a
i
+
a
i+1
+
b
i
2
)
without any rounding (so values may become non-integer).
See notes for an example of an operation.
It can be proven that array
a
converges, i. e. for each
i
there exists a limit
a
i
converges to. Let function
F(a,b)
return the value
a
1
converges to after a process on
a
and
b
.
You are given array
b
, but not array
a
. However, you are given a third array
c
. Array
a
is good if it contains only integers and satisfies
0≤
a
i
≤
c
i
for
1≤i≤n
.
Your task is to count the number of good arrays
a
where
F(a,b)≥x
for
q
values of
x
. Since the number of arrays can be very large, print it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤100
).
The second line contains
n
integers
c
1
,
c
2
…,
c
n
(
0≤
c
i
≤100
).
The third line contains
n−1
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n−1
(
0≤
b
i
≤100
).
The fourth line contains a single integer
q
(
q=1
).
The fifth line contains
q
space separated integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
q
(
−

≤
x
i
≤

).
Output
Output
q
integers, where the
i
-th integer is the answer to the
i
-th query, i. e. the number of good arrays
a
where
F(a,b)≥
x
i
modulo
10

+7
.

Note
The following explanation assumes
b=[2,1]
and
c=[2,3,4]
(as in the sample).
Examples of arrays
a
that are not good:
a=[3,2,3]
is not good because
a
1
>
c
1
;
a=[0,−1,3]
is not good because
a
2
<0
.
One possible good array
a
is
[0,2,4]
. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so
F(a,b)=
a
1
=0
.
Another possible good array
a
is
[0,1,4]
. In a single operation with
i=1
, we set
a
1
=min(
0+1−2
2
,0)
and
a
2
=max(
0+1+2
2
,1)
. So, after a single operation with
i=1
,
a
becomes equal to
[−
1
2
,
3
2
,4]
. We can show that no operation has any effect on this array, so
F(a,b)=−
1
2
.
