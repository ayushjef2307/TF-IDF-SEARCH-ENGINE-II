Farmer John has a farm that consists of
n
pastures connected by one-directional roads. Each road has a weight, representing the time it takes to go from the start to the end of the road. The roads could have negative weight, where the cows go so fast that they go back in time! However, Farmer John guarantees that it is impossible for the cows to get stuck in a time loop, where they can infinitely go back in time by traveling across a sequence of roads. Also, each pair of pastures is connected by at most one road in each direction.
Unfortunately, Farmer John lost the map of the farm. All he remembers is an array
d
, where
d
i
is the smallest amount of time it took the cows to reach the
i
-th pasture from pasture
1
using a sequence of roads. The cost of his farm is the sum of the weights of each of the roads, and Farmer John needs to know the minimal cost of a farm that is consistent with his memory.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of pastures.
The second line of each test case contains
n
space separated integers
d
1
,
d
2
,…,
d
n
(
0≤
d
i
≤
10
9
) — the array
d
. It is guaranteed that
d
1
=0
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output the minimum possible cost of a farm that is consistent with Farmer John's memory.

.
In the second test case, you can add a road from pasture
1
to pasture
2
with cost
1000000000
and a road from pasture
2
to pasture
1
with cost
−1000000000
. The total cost is
1000000000+−1000000000=0
.
In the third test case, you can't add any roads. The total cost is
0
.
