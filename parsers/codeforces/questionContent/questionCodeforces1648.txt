Polycarp has
x
of red and
y
of blue candies. Using them, he wants to make gift sets. Each gift set contains either
a
red candies and
b
blue candies, or
a
blue candies and
b
red candies. Any candy can belong to at most one gift set.
Help Polycarp to find the largest number of gift sets he can create.
For example, if
x=10
,
y=12
,
a=5
, and
b=2
, then Polycarp can make three gift sets:
In the first set there will be
5
red candies and
2
blue candies;
In the second set there will be
5
blue candies and
2
red candies;
In the third set will be
5
blue candies and
2
red candies.
Note that in this example there is one red candy that Polycarp does not use in any gift set.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case consists of a single string containing four integers
x
,
y
,
a
, and
b
(
1≤x,y,a,b≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, output one number — the maximum number of gift sets that Polycarp can make.
