You are given two integers
l
and
r
, where
l<r
. We will add
1
to
l
until the result is equal to
r
. Thus, there will be exactly
r−l
additions performed. For each such addition, let's look at the number of digits that will be changed after it.
For example:
if
l=909
, then adding one will result in
910
and
2
digits will be changed;
if you add one to
l=9
, the result will be
10
and
2
digits will also be changed;
if you add one to
l=489999
, the result will be
490000
and
5
digits will be changed.
Changed digits always form a suffix of the result written in the decimal system.
Output the total number of changed digits, if you want to get
r
from
l
, adding
1
each time.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case is characterized by two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l<r≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, calculate the total number of changed digits if you want to get
r
from
l
, adding one each time.
