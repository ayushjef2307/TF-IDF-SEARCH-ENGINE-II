You are given two integers
a
and
b
. In one turn, you can do one of the following operations:
Take an integer
c
(
c>1
and
a
should be divisible by
c
) and replace
a
with
a
c
;
Take an integer
c
(
c>1
and
b
should be divisible by
c
) and replace
b
with
b
c
.
Your goal is to make
a
equal to
b
using exactly
k
turns.
For example, the numbers
a=36
and
b=48
can be made equal in
4
moves:
c=6
, divide
b
by
c
⇒
a=36
,
b=8
;
c=2
, divide
a
by
c
⇒
a=18
,
b=8
;
c=9
, divide
a
by
c
⇒
a=2
,
b=8
;
c=4
, divide
b
by
c
⇒
a=2
,
b=2
.
For the given numbers
a
and
b
, determine whether it is possible to make them equal using exactly
k
turns.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case is contains three integers
a
,
b
and
k
(
1≤a,b,k≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case output:
"Yes", if it is possible to make the numbers
a
and
b
equal in exactly
k
turns;
"No" otherwise.
The strings "Yes" and "No" can be output in any case.
