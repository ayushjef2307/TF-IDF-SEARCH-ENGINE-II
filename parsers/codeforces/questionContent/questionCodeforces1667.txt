Suppose you are given two strings
a
and
b
. You can apply the following operation any number of times: choose any contiguous substring of
a
or
b
, and sort the characters in it in non-descending order. Let
f(a,b)
the minimum number of operations you have to apply in order to make them equal (or
f(a,b)=1337
if it is impossible to make
a
and
b
equal using these operations).
For example:
f(ab,ab)=0
;
f(ba,ab)=1
(in one operation, we can sort the whole first string);
f(ebcda,ecdba)=1
(in one operation, we can sort the substring of the second string starting from the
2
-nd character and ending with the
4
-th character);
f(a,b)=1337
.
You are given
n

Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of strings.
Then
n
lines follow, each line contains one of the strings
s
i
, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
