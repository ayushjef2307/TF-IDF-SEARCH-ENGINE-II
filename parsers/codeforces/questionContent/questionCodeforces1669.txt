2
k
teams participate in a playoff tournament. The tournament consists of
2
k
−1
games. They are held as follows: first of all, the teams are split into pairs: team
1
plays against team
2
, team
3
plays against team
4
(exactly in this order), and so on (so,
2
k−1
games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only
2
k−1
teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise,
2
k−2
games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game "
1
vs
2
" plays against the winner of the game "
3
vs
4
", then the winner of the game "
5
vs
6
" plays against the winner of the game "
7
vs
8
", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains.
For example, this picture describes the chronological order of games with
k=3
:
Let the string
s
consisting of
2
k
−1
characters describe the results of the games in chronological order as follows:
if
s
i
is 0, then the team with lower index wins the
i
-th game;
if
s
i
is 1, then the team with greater index wins the
i
-th game;
if
s
i
is ?, then the result of the
i
-th game is unknown (any team could win this game).
Let
f(s)
be the number of possible winners of the tournament described by the string
s
. A team
i
is a possible winner of the tournament if it is possible to replace every ? with either 1 or 0 in such a way that team
i
is the champion.
You are given the initial state of the string
s
. You have to process
q
queries of the following form:
p
c
 — replace
s
p
with character
c
, and print
f(s)
as the result of the query.
Input
The first line contains one integer
k
(
1≤k≤18
).
The second line contains a string consisting of
2
k
−1
characters — the initial state of the string
s
. Each character is either ?, 0, or 1.
The third line contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of queries.
Then
q
lines follow, the
i
-th line contains an integer
p
and a character
c
(
1≤p≤
2
k
−1
;
c
is either ?, 0, or 1), describing the
i
-th query.
Output
For each query, print one integer —
f(s)
.
