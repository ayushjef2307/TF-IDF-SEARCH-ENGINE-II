The boy Vitya loves to listen to music very much. He knows that
n
albums are due to be released this Friday,
i
-th of which contains
k
i
tracks. Of course, Vitya has already listened to all the tracks, and knows that in the
i
-th album, the coolness of the
j
-th track is equal to
a
i,j
.
Vitya has a friend Masha, whom he really wants to invite to the festival, where his favorite bands perform. However, in order for a friend to agree, she must first evaluate the released novelties. Vitya knows that if Masha listens to a track that was cooler than all the previous ones, she will get 1 unit of impression. Unfortunately, albums can only be listened to in their entirety, without changing the songs in them in places.
Help Vitya find such an order of albums so that Masha's impression turns out to be as much as possible, and she definitely went to the festival with him.

Note
In the first test example, the optimal order is listening to the 4th, 2nd, 3rd and 1st albums.
In this case, Masha will listen to the tracks in the following order: 1; 7; 8, 6; 4, 9, 4, 6, 8 and will receive 4 units of impression.
In the second test example, you must first listen to the 1st, then the 4th, and in any order the 2nd and 3rd. In this case, Masha will get the maximum impression, and for every song in the 1st and 4th albums and nothing for the 2nd and 3rd.
