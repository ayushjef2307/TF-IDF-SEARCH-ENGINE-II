Annie has gotten bored of winning every coding contest and farming unlimited rating. Today, she is going to farm potatoes instead.
Annie's garden is an infinite 2D plane. She has
n
potatoes to plant, and the
i
-th potato must be planted at
(
x
i
,
y
i
)
. Starting at the point
(0,0)
, Annie begins walking, in one step she can travel one unit right or up (increasing her
x
or
y
coordinate by
1
respectively). At any point
(X,Y)
during her walk she can plant some potatoes at arbitrary points using her potato gun, consuming
max(|X−x|,|Y−y|)
units of energy in order to plant a potato at
(x,y)
. Find the minimum total energy required to plant every potato.
Note that Annie may plant any number of potatoes from any point.
Input
The first line contains the integer
n
(
1≤n≤800000
).
The next
n
lines contain two integers
x
i
and
y
i
(
0≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤
10
9
), representing the location of the
i
-th potato. It is possible that some potatoes should be planted in the same location.
Output
Print the minimum total energy to plant all potatoes.

Note
In example
1
, Annie can travel to each spot directly and plant a potato with no energy required.
In example
2
, moving to
(1,0)
, Annie plants the second potato using
1
energy. Next, she travels to
(1,1)
and plants the first potato with
0
energy.
