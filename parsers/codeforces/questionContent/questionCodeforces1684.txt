You are given matrix
s
that contains
n
rows and
m
columns. Each element of a matrix is one of the
5
first Latin letters (in upper case).
For each
k
(
1≤k≤5
) calculate the number of submatrices that contain exactly
k
different letters. Recall that a submatrix of matrix
s
is a matrix that can be obtained from
s
after removing several (possibly zero) first rows, several (possibly zero) last rows, several (possibly zero) first columns, and several (possibly zero) last columns. If some submatrix can be obtained from
s
in two or more ways, you have to count this submatrix the corresponding number of times.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤800
).
Then
n
lines follow, each containing the string
s
i
(
|
s
i
|=m
) —
i
-th row of the matrix.
Output
For each
k
(
1≤k≤5
) print one integer — the number of submatrices that contain exactly
k
different letters.
