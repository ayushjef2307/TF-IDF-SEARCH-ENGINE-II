You are given an array
s
consisting of
n
different strings. Each string consists of
m
lowercase Latin letters.
You have to respond to
q
queries. Each query contains a string
t
of length
m+1
. Count the number of indices
i
, such that the string
t
can be obtained from the string
s
i
, if it is allowed to insert one letter in an arbitrary position.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤
10
5
;
1≤m≤10
) — the number of strings in the array and the length of each string.
The following
n
lines contain strings
s
i
. All of the given strings are different.
The next line contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤
10
5
) — the number of queries.
The following
q
lines contain query strings
t
of length
m+1
.
Output
For each query, print the number of indices
i
, such that a string from the query can be obtained from the string
s
i
, if it is allowed to insert one letter in an arbitrary position.

Note
Explanation of the first test of the example:
the string a can be transformed into aa by inserting one letter;
both strings a and c can be transformed into ca by inserting one letter;
neither a nor c can be transformed into mm by inserting one letter;
c can be transformed into cf by inserting one letter.
