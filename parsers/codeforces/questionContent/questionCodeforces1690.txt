Your friend has created a nearest point function. For a given array of integer points
x
(sorted in ascending order, without any duplicates) and a point
y
it can find the nearest point from
x
to the point
y
. In other words, it will find such a point
x
i
that
|y−
x
i
|
is the minimum possible, where
|a|
is the absolute value of
a
.
For example, if
x=[1,2,5,7,9,11]
, the answer for
y=3
will be
2
, the answer for
y=5
will be
5
and the answer for
y=100
will be
11
.
This function is a bit buggy, though. If there are several nearest points to the given one, the function crashes. For example, if
x=[1,2,5,7,9,11]
(as above) and
y=6
, the function will crash, since points
5
and
7
are both the nearest points for
6
.
Your task is, for a given array of integer points
x
(sorted in ascending order, without any duplicates), determine if it is possible to cause the function to crash by choosing some integer point
y
.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of the test case contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of points in the array
x
.
The second line of the test case contains
n
integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
(
1≤
x
i
≤
10
9
), where
x
i
is the
i
-th point in the array
x
.
All points in the array
x
are distinct, and the array
x
is sorted in ascending order (in other words,
x
1
<
x
2
<…<
x
n
).
The sum of
n
over the test cases in the input does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
(
∑n≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
For each test case, print YES if it is possible to find some integer point
y
that will crash the function and NO otherwise.

Note
In the first test case of the example, the function crashes if
y=2
is chosen.
In the fifth test case of the example, the function crashes if
y=500000000
is chosen.
In the sixth test case of the example, the function crashes if
y=10
is chosen.
