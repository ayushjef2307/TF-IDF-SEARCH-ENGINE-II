You have two strings
a
and
b
of equal length
n
consisting of characters 0 and 1, and an integer
k
.
You need to make strings
a
and
b
equal.
In one step, you can choose any substring of
a
containing exactly
k
characters 1 (and arbitrary number of characters 0) and reverse it. Formally, if
a=
a
1
a
2
…
a
n
, you can choose any integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) such that there are exactly
k
ones among characters
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
, and set
a
to
a
1
a
2
…
a
l−1
a
r
a
r−1
…
a
l
a
r+1
a
r+2
…
a
n
.
Find a way to make
a
equal to
b
using at most
4n
reversals of the above kind, or determine that such a way doesn't exist. The number of reversals doesn't have to be minimized.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤2000
). Description of the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of three lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2000
;
0≤k≤n
).
The second line contains string
a
of length
n
.
The third line contains string
b
of the same length. Both strings consist of characters 0 and 1.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2000
.
Output
For each test case, if it's impossible to make
a
equal to
b
in at most
4n
reversals, print a single integer
−1
.
Otherwise, print an integer
m
(
0≤m≤4n
), denoting the number of reversals in your sequence of steps, followed by
m
pairs of integers
l
i
,
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
), denoting the boundaries of the substrings of
a
to be reversed, in chronological order. Each substring must contain exactly
k
ones at the moment of reversal.
Note that
m
doesn't have to be minimized. If there are multiple answers, print any.
