Getting ready for VK Fest 2021, you prepared a table with
n
rows and
n
columns, and filled each cell of this table with some event related with the festival that could either happen or not: for example, whether you will win a prize on the festival, or whether it will rain.
Forecasting algorithms used in VK have already estimated the probability for each event to happen. Event in row
i
and column
j
will happen with probability
a
i,j
⋅
10
−4
. All of the events are mutually independent.
Let's call the table winning if there exists a line such that all
n
events on it happen. The line could be any horizontal line (cells
(i,1),(i,2),…,(i,n)
for some
i
), any vertical line (cells
(1,j),(2,j),…,(n,j)
for some
j
), the main diagonal (cells
(1,1),(2,2),…,(n,n)
), or the antidiagonal (cells
(1,n),(2,n−1),…,(n,1)
).
Find the probability of your table to be winning, and output it modulo
31607
(see Output section).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
 (
2≤n≤21
) — the dimensions of the table.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains
n
integers
a
i,1
,
a
i,2
,…,
a
i,n
(
0<
a
i,j
<
10
4
). The probability of event in cell
(i,j)
to happen is
a
i,j
⋅
10
−4
.
Output
Print the probability that your table will be winning, modulo
31607
.
Formally, let
M=31607
. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction
p
q
, where
p
and
q
are integers and
q≢0(modM)
. Output the integer equal to
p⋅
q
−1
modM
. In other words, output such an integer
x
that
0≤x<M
and
x⋅q≡p(modM)
.

Note
In the first example, any two events form a line, and the table will be winning if any two events happen. The probability of this is
11
16
, and
5927⋅16≡11(mod31607)
.
