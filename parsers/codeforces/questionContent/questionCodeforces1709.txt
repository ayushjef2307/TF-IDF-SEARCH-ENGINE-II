Prefix function of string
t=
t
1
t
2
…
t
n
and position
i
in it is defined as the length
k
of the longest proper (not equal to the whole substring) prefix of substring
t
1
t
2
…
t
i
which is also a suffix of the same substring.
For example, for string
t=
abacaba the values of the prefix function in positions
1,2,…,7
are equal to
[0,0,1,0,1,2,3]
.
Let
f(t)
be equal to the maximum value of the prefix function of string
t
over all its positions. For example,
f(
abacaba
)=3
.
You are given a string
s
. Reorder its characters arbitrarily to get a string
t
(the number of occurrences of any character in strings
s
and
t
must be equal). The value of
f(t)
must be minimized. Out of all options to minimize
f(t)
, choose the one where string
t
is the lexicographically smallest.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
). Description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains string
s
(
1≤|s|≤
10
5
) consisting of lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of
s
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print a single string
t
.
The multisets of letters in strings
s
and
t
must be equal. The value of
f(t)
, the maximum of prefix functions in string
t
, must be as small as possible. String
t
must be the lexicographically smallest string out of all strings satisfying the previous conditions.

Copy

zzzzzz
Note
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
if and only if one of the following holds:
a
is a prefix of
b
, but
a≠b
;
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
In the first test case,
f(t)=0
and the values of prefix function are
[0,0,0,0,0]
for any permutation of letters. String ckpuv is the lexicographically smallest permutation of letters of string vkcup.
In the second test case,
f(t)=1
and the values of prefix function are
[0,1,0,1,0,1,0]
.
In the third test case,
f(t)=5
and the values of prefix function are
[0,1,2,3,4,5]
.
