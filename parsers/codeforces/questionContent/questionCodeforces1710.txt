Every December, VK traditionally holds an event for its employees named "Secret Santa". Here's how it happens.
n
employees numbered from
1
to
n
take part in the event. Each employee
i
is assigned a different employee
b
i
, to which employee
i
has to make a new year gift. Each employee is assigned to exactly one other employee, and nobody is assigned to themselves (but two employees may be assigned to each other). Formally, all
b
i
must be distinct integers between
1
and
n
, and for any
i
,
b
i
≠i
must hold.
The assignment is usually generated randomly. This year, as an experiment, all event participants have been asked who they wish to make a gift to. Each employee
i
has said that they wish to make a gift to employee
a
i
.
Find a valid assignment
b
that maximizes the number of fulfilled wishes of the employees.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
). Description of the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer
n
 (
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of participants of the event.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
 (
1≤
a
i
≤n
;
a
i
≠i
) — wishes of the employees in order from
1
to
n
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print two lines.
In the first line, print a single integer
k
 (
0≤k≤n
) — the number of fulfilled wishes in your assignment.
In the second line, print
n
distinct integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤n
;
b
i
≠i
) — the numbers of employees assigned to employees
1,2,…,n
.
k
must be equal to the number of values of
i
such that
a
i
=
b
i
, and must be as large as possible. If there are multiple answers, print any.

Note
In the first test case, two valid assignments exist:
[3,1,2]
and
[2,3,1]
. The former assignment fulfills two wishes, while the latter assignment fulfills only one. Therefore,
k=2
, and the only correct answer is
[3,1,2]
.
