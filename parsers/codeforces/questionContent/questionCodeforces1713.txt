Let's call a number a binary decimal if it's a positive integer and all digits in its decimal notation are either
0
or
1
. For example,
1010111
is a binary decimal, while
10201
and
787788
are not.
Given a number
n
, you are asked to represent
n
as a sum of some (not necessarily distinct) binary decimals. Compute the smallest number of binary decimals required for that.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
), denoting the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
9
), denoting the number to be represented.
Output
For each test case, output the smallest number of binary decimals required to represent
n
as a sum.

Note
In the first test case,
121
can be represented as
121=110+11
or
121=111+10
.
In the second test case,
5
can be represented as
5=1+1+1+1+1
.
In the third test case,
1000000000
is a binary decimal itself, thus the answer is
1
.
