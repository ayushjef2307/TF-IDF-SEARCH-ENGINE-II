To AmShZ, all arrays are equal, but some arrays are more-equal than others. Specifically, the arrays consisting of
n
elements from
1
to
n
that can be turned into permutations of numbers from
1
to
n
by adding a non-negative integer to each element.
Mashtali who wants to appear in every problem statement thinks that an array
b
consisting of
k
elements is compatible with a more-equal array
a
consisting of
n
elements if for each
1≤i≤k
we have
1≤
b
i
≤n
and also
a
b
1
=
a
b
2
=…=
a
b
k
.
Find the number of pairs of arrays
a
and
b
such that
a
is a more-equal array consisting of
n
elements and
b
is an array compatible with
a
consisting of
k
elements modulo
998244353
.
Note that the elements of
b
are not necessarily distinct, same holds for
a
.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers
n
and
k
(1≤n≤

)
.
Output
Print a single integer — the answer to the problem modulo
998244353
.

Note
There are eight possible pairs for the second example:
a={1,1},b={1,1}
a={1,1},b={1,2}
a={1,1},b={2,1}
a={1,1},b={2,2}
a={1,2},b={1,1}
a={1,2},b={2,2}
a={2,1},b={1,1}
a={2,1},b={2,2}
