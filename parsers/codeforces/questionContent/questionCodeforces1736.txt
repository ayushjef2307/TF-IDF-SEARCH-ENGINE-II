Monocarp is playing a game "Assimilation IV". In this game he manages a great empire: builds cities and conquers new lands.
Monocarp's empire has
n
cities. In order to conquer new lands he plans to build one Monument in each city. The game is turn-based and, since Monocarp is still amateur, he builds exactly one Monument per turn.
Monocarp has
m
points on the map he'd like to control using the constructed Monuments. For each point he knows the distance between it and each city. Monuments work in the following way: when built in some city, a Monument controls all points at distance at most
1
to this city. Next turn, the Monument controls all points at distance at most
2
, the turn after — at distance at most
3
, and so on. Monocarp will build
n
Monuments in
n
turns and his empire will conquer all points that are controlled by at least one Monument.
Monocarp can't figure out any strategy, so during each turn he will choose a city for a Monument randomly among all remaining cities (cities without Monuments). Monocarp wants to know how many points (among
m
of them) he will conquer at the end of turn number
n
. Help him to calculate the expected number of conquered points!
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤20
;
1≤m≤5⋅
10
4
) — the number of cities and the number of points.
Next
n
lines contains
m
integers each: the
j
-th integer of the
i
-th line
d
i,j
(
1≤
d
i,j
≤n+1
) is the distance between the
i
-th city and the
j
-th point.
Output
It can be shown that the expected number of points Monocarp conquers at the end of the
n
-th turn can be represented as an irreducible fraction
x
y
. Print this fraction modulo
998244353
, i. e. value

where

is such number that

Note
Let's look at all possible orders of cities Monuments will be build in:
[1,2,3]
:
the first city controls all points at distance at most
3
, in other words, points
1
and
4
;
the second city controls all points at distance at most
2
, or points
1
,
3
and
5
;
the third city controls all points at distance at most
1
, or point
1
.
In total,
4
points are controlled.
[1,3,2]
: the first city controls points
1
and
4
; the second city — points
1
and
3
; the third city — point
1
. In total,
3
points.
[2,1,3]
: the first city controls point
1
; the second city — points
1
,
3
and
5
; the third city — point
1
. In total,
3
points.
[2,3,1]
: the first city controls point
1
; the second city — points
1
,
3
and
5
; the third city — point
1
. In total,
3
points.
[3,1,2]
: the first city controls point
1
; the second city — points
1
and
3
; the third city — points
1
and
5
. In total,
3
points.
[3,2,1]
: the first city controls point
1
; the second city — points
1
,
3
and
5
; the third city — points
1
and
5
. In total,
3
points.
The expected number of controlled points is
