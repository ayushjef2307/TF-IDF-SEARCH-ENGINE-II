There are
n
armchairs, numbered from
1
to
n
from left to right. Some armchairs are occupied by people (at most one person per armchair), others are not. The number of occupied armchairs is not greater than
n
2
.
For some reason, you would like to tell people to move from their armchairs to some other ones. If the
i
-th armchair is occupied by someone and the
j
-th armchair is not, you can tell the person sitting in the
i
-th armchair to move to the
j
-th armchair. The time it takes a person to move from the
i
-th armchair to the
j
-th one is
|i−j|
minutes. You may perform this operation any number of times, but these operations must be done sequentially, i. e. you cannot tell a person to move until the person you asked to move in the last operation has finished moving to their destination armchair.
You want to achieve the following situation: every seat that was initially occupied must be free. What is the minimum time you need to do it?
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤5000
) — the number of armchairs.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
0≤ai≤1
).
ai=1
means that the
i
-th armchair is initially occupied,
ai=0
means that it is initially free. The number of occupied armchairs is at most
n
2
.
Output
Print one integer — the minimum number of minutes you have to spend to achieve the following situation: every seat that was initially occupied must be free.

Note
In the first test, you can perform the following sequence:
ask a person to move from armchair
1
to armchair
2
, it takes
1
minute;
ask a person to move from armchair
7
to armchair
6
, it takes
1
minute;
ask a person to move from armchair
4
to armchair
5
, it takes
1
minute.
In the second test, you can perform the following sequence:
ask a person to move from armchair
1
to armchair
4
, it takes
3
minutes;
ask a person to move from armchair
2
to armchair
6
, it takes
4
minutes;
ask a person to move from armchair
4
to armchair
5
, it takes
1
minute;
ask a person to move from armchair
3
to armchair
4
, it takes
1
minute.
In the third test, no seat is occupied so your goal is achieved instantly.
