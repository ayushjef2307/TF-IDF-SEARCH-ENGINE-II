You like numbers, don't you? Nastia has a lot of numbers and she wants to share them with you! Isn't it amazing?
Let
a
i
be how many numbers
i
(
1≤i≤k
) you have.
An
n×n
matrix is called beautiful if it contains all the numbers you have, and for each
2×2
submatrix of the original matrix is satisfied:
The number of occupied cells doesn't exceed
3
;
The numbers on each diagonal are distinct.
Make a beautiful matrix of minimum size.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤10000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains
2
integers
m
and
k
(
1≤m,k≤
10
5
) — how many numbers Nastia gave you and the length of the array
a
, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
k
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
k
(
0≤
a
i
≤m
,
a
1
+
a
2
+…+
a
k
=m
), where
a
i
is how many numbers
i
you have.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
m
and
k
in one test doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each
t
test case print a single integer
n
 — the size of the beautiful matrix.
In the next
n
lines print
n
integers
b
i,j
(
0≤
b
i,j
≤k
; if position is empty, print
b
i,j
=0
) — the beautiful matrix
b
you made up.
