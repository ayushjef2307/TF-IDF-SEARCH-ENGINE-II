Let's call a positive integer
n
ordinary if in the decimal notation all its digits are the same. For example,
1
,
2
and
99
are ordinary numbers, but
719
and
2021
are not ordinary numbers.
For a given number
n
, find the number of ordinary numbers among the numbers from
1
to
n
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case is characterized by one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case output the number of ordinary numbers among numbers from
1
to
n
.
