After hearing the story of Dr. Zhang, Wowo decides to plan his own flight around the world.
He already chose
n
checkpoints in the world map. Due to the landform and the clouds, he cannot fly too high or too low. Formally, let
b
i
be the height of Wowo's aircraft at checkpoint
i
,
x
−
i
≤
b
i
≤
x
+
i
should be satisfied for all integers
i
between
1
and
n
, where
x
−
i
and
x
+
i
are given integers.
The angle of Wowo's aircraft is also limited. For example, it cannot make a
90
-degree climb. Formally,
y
−
i
≤
b
i
−
b
i−1
≤
y
+
i
should be satisfied for all integers
i
between
2
and
n
, where
y
−
i
and
y
+
i
are given integers.
The final limitation is the speed of angling up or angling down. An aircraft should change its angle slowly for safety concerns. Formally,
z
−
i
≤(
b
i
−
b
i−1
)−(
b
i−1
−
b
i−2
)≤
z
+
i
should be satisfied for all integers
i
between
3
and
n
, where
z
−
i
and
z
+
i
are given integers.
Taking all these into consideration, Wowo finds that the heights at checkpoints are too hard for him to choose. Please help Wowo decide whether there exists a sequence of real numbers
b
1
,…,
b
n
satisfying all the contraints above.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤66666
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤100000
).
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains two integers
x
−
i
,
x
+
i
(
−
10
8
≤
x
−
i
≤
x
+
i
≤
10
8
) denoting the lower and upper bound of
b
i
.
The
i
-th of the next
n−1
lines contains two integers
y
−
i+1
,
y
+
i+1
(
−
10
8
≤
y
−
i+1
≤
y
+
i+1
≤
10
8
) denoting the lower and upper bound of
b
i+1
−
b
i
.
The
i
-th of the next
n−2
lines contains two integers
z
−
i+2
,
z
+
i+2
(
−
10
8
≤
z
−
i+2
≤
z
+
i+2
≤
10
8
) denoting the lower and upper bound of
(
b
i+2
−
b
i+1
)−(
b
i+1
−
b
i
)
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
200000
.
It is guaranteed that relaxing every constraint by
10
−6
(i.e., decrease
x
−
i
,
y
−
i
,
z
−
i
by
10
−6
and increase
x
+
i
,
y
+
i
,
z
+
i
by
10
−6
) will not change the answer.
Output
For each test case, output YES if a sequence
b
1
,…,
b
n
satisfying the constraints exists and NO otherwise. The sequence
b
1
,…,
b
n
is not required.

Note
In the first test case, all
b
i
's are in
[0,1]
. Because of the constraints
1=
y
−
2
≤
b
2
−
b
1
≤
y
+
2
=1
,
b
2
−
b
1
must be
1
. So
b
2
=1
and
b
1
=0
must hold. Then by
1=
y
−
3
≤
b
3
−
b
2
≤
y
+
3
=1
,
b
3
equals
2
. This contradicts the constraint of
b
3
≤1
. So no solution exists.
In the second test case, we can let all
b
i
's be
0
.
In the third test case, one possible solution is
b
1
=0
,
b
2
=1/3
,
b
3
=2/3
,
b
4
=1
.
