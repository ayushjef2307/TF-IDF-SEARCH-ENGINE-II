This time around, Baby Ehab will play with permutations. He has
n
cubes arranged in a row, with numbers from
1
to
n
written on them. He'll make exactly
j
operations. In each operation, he'll pick up
2
cubes and switch their positions.
He's wondering: how many different sequences of cubes can I have at the end? Since Baby Ehab is a turbulent person, he doesn't know how many operations he'll make, so he wants the answer for every possible
j
between
1
and
k
.
Input
The only line contains
2
integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤
10
9
,
1≤k≤200
) — the number of cubes Baby Ehab has, and the parameter
k
from the statement.
Output
Print
k
space-separated integers. The
i
-th of them is the number of possible sequences you can end up with if you do exactly
i
operations. Since this number can be very large, print the remainder when it's divided by
10
9
+7
.

Note
In the second example, there are
3
sequences he can get after
1
swap, because there are
3
pairs of cubes he can swap. Also, there are
3
sequences he can get after
2
swaps:
[1,2,3]
,
[3,1,2]
,
[2,3,1]
.
