To satisfy his love of matching socks, Phoenix has brought his
n
socks (
n
is even) to the sock store. Each of his socks has a color
c
i
and is either a left sock or right sock.
Phoenix can pay one dollar to the sock store to either:
recolor a sock to any color
c
′
(1≤
c
′
≤n)
turn a left sock into a right sock
turn a right sock into a left sock
The sock store may perform each of these changes any number of times. Note that the color of a left sock doesn't change when it turns into a right sock, and vice versa.
A matching pair of socks is a left and right sock with the same color. What is the minimum cost for Phoenix to make
n/2
matching pairs? Each sock must be included in exactly one matching pair.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
l
, and
r
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;
n
is even;
0≤l,r≤n
;
l+r=n
) — the total number of socks, and the number of left and right socks, respectively.
The next line contains
n
integers
c
i
(
1≤
c
i
≤n
) — the colors of the socks. The first
l
socks are left socks, while the next
r
socks are right socks.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
across all the test cases will not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum cost for Phoenix to make
n/2
matching pairs. Each sock must be included in exactly one matching pair.

Note
In the first test case, Phoenix can pay
2
dollars to:
recolor sock

There are now
3
matching pairs. For example, pairs
(1,4)
,
(2,5)
, and
(3,6)
are matching.
In the second test case, Phoenix can pay
