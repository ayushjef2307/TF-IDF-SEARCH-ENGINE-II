You are given 2 arrays
a
and
b
, both of size
n
. You can swap two elements in
b
at most once (or leave it as it is), and you are required to minimize the value
∑

Note
In the first example, we can swap the first and fifth element in array
b
, so that it becomes
[5,2,3,4,1]
.
Therefore, the minimum possible value of this sum would be
|5−5|+|4−2|+|3−3|+|2−4|+|1−1|=4
.
In the second example, we can swap the first and second elements. So, our answer would be
2
.
