A sequence of
n
non-negative integers (
n≥2
)
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
is called good if for all
i
from
1
to
n−1
the following condition holds true:
a
1
&
a
2
&…&
a
i
=
a
i+1
&
a
i+2
&…&
a
n
,
&
&
&
&
&
&
where
&
denotes the bitwise AND operation.
You are given an array
a
of size
n
(
n≥2
). Find the number of permutations
p
of numbers ranging from
1
to
n
, for which the sequence
a
p
1
,
a
p
2
, ... ,
a
p
n
is good. Since this number can be large, output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
), denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
Output
t
lines, where the
i
-th line contains the number of good permutations in the
i
-th test case modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
In the first test case, since all the numbers are equal, whatever permutation we take, the sequence is good. There are a total of
6
permutations possible with numbers from
1
to
3
:
[1,2,3]
,
[1,3,2]
,
[2,1,3]
,
[2,3,1]
,
[3,1,2]
,
[3,2,1]
.
In the second test case, it can be proved that no permutation exists for which the sequence is good.
In the third test case, there are a total of
36
permutations for which the sequence is good. One of them is the permutation
[1,5,4,2,3]
which results in the sequence
s=[0,0,3,2,0]
. This is a good sequence because
