There are
n
people that will participate in voting. Each person has exactly one vote.
i
-th person has a team
t
i
(
1≤
t
i
≤n
) where
t
i
=
t
j
means
i
,
j
are in the same team. By the rules each person should vote for the person from the different team. Note that it automatically means that each person can't vote for himself.
Each person knows the number of votes
c
i
he wants to get. How many possible votings exists, such that each person will get the desired number of votes? Due to this number can be big, find it by modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤200
) — the number of people.
The second line contains
n
integers
c
1

c
n
(
0≤
c
i
≤n
) — desired number of votes. It is guaranteed, that

Output
Print a single integer — the number of possible votings by modulo
