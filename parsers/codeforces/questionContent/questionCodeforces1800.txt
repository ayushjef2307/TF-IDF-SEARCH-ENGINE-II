A sequence of
n
integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from
1
to
n
exactly once.
Given two integers
n
and
k
, construct a permutation
a
of numbers from
1
to
n
which has exactly
k
peaks. An index
i
of an array
a
of size
n
is said to be a peak if
1<i<n
and
a
i
>
a
i−1
and
a
i
>
a
i+1
. If such permutation is not possible, then print
−1
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
Then
t
lines follow, each containing two space-separated integers
n
(
1≤n≤100
) and
k
(
0≤k≤n
) — the length of an array and the required number of peaks.
Output
Output
t
lines. For each test case, if there is no permutation with given length and number of peaks, then print
−1
. Otherwise print a line containing
n
space-separated integers which forms a permutation of numbers from
1
to
n
and contains exactly
k
peaks.
If there are multiple answers, print any.

Note
In the second test case of the example, we have array
a=[2,4,1,5,3]
. Here, indices
i=2
and
i=4
are the peaks of the array. This is because
(
a
2
>
a
1
,
a
2
>
a
3
)
and
(
a
4
>
a
3
,
a
4
>
a
5
)
.
