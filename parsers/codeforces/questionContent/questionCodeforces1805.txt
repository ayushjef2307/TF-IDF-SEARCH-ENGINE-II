You are given a string
s
consisting of the characters '0', '1', and '?'. You need to replace all the characters with '?' in the string
s
by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has exactly
a
characters '0' and exactly
b
characters '1'. Note that each of the characters '?' is replaced independently from the others.
A string
t
of length
n
is called a palindrome if the equality
t[i]=t[n−i+1]
is true for all
i
(
1≤i≤n
).
For example, if
s=
"01?????0",
a=4
and
b=4
, then you can replace the characters '?' in the following ways:
"01011010";
"01100110".
For the given string
s
and the numbers
a
and
b
, replace all the characters with '?' in the string
s
by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and has exactly
a
characters '0' and exactly
b
characters '1'.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(
0≤a,b≤2⋅
10
5
,
a+b≥1
).
The second line of each test case contains the string
s
of length
a+b
, consisting of the characters '0', '1', and '?'.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the string lengths of
s
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output:
"-1", if you can't replace all the characters '?' in the string
s
by '0' or '1' so that the string becomes a palindrome and that it contains exactly
a
characters '0' and exactly
b
characters '1';
the string that is obtained as a result of the replacement, otherwise.
If there are several suitable ways to replace characters, you can output any.
