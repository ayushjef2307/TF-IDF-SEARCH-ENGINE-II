Let's define the cost of a string
s
as the number of index pairs
i
and
j
(
1≤i<j<|s|
) such that
s
i
=
s
j
and
s
i+1
=
s
j+1
.
You are given two positive integers
n
and
k
. Among all strings with length
n
that contain only the first
k
characters of the Latin alphabet, find a string with minimum possible cost. If there are multiple such strings with minimum cost — find any of them.
Input
The only line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;1≤k≤26
).
Output
Print the string
s
such that it consists of
n
characters, each its character is one of the
k
first Latin letters, and it has the minimum possible cost among all these strings. If there are multiple such strings — print any of them.
