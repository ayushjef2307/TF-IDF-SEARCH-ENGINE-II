You are given a set of
n
segments on a line
[
L
i
;
R
i
]
. All
2n
segment endpoints are pairwise distinct integers.
The set is laminar — any two segments are either disjoint or one of them contains the other.
Choose a non-empty subsegment
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
with integer endpoints in each segment (
L
i
≤
l
i
<
r
i
≤
R
i
) in such a way that no two subsegments intersect (they are allowed to have common endpoints though) and the sum of their lengths (
∑
n
i=1
r
i
−
l
i
) is maximized.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
3
) — the number of segments.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains two integers
L
i
and
R
i
(
0≤
L
i
<
R
i
≤
10
9
) — the endpoints of the
i
-th segment.
All the given
2n
segment endpoints are distinct. The set of segments is laminar.
Output
On the first line, output the maximum possible sum of subsegment lengths.
On the
i
-th of the next
n
lines, output two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
L
i
≤
l
i
<
r
i
≤
R
i
), denoting the chosen subsegment of the
i
-th segment.
