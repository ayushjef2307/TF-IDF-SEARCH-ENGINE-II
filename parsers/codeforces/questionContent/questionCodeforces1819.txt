Imagine a board with
n
pins put into it, the
i
-th pin is located at
(
x
i
,
y
i
)
. For simplicity, we will restrict the problem to the case where the pins are placed in vertices of a convex polygon.
Then, take a non-stretchable string of length
l
, and put it around all the pins. Place a pencil inside the string and draw a curve around the pins, trying to pull the string in every possible direction. The picture below shows an example of a string tied around the pins and pulled by a pencil (a point
P
).
Your task is to find an area inside this curve. Formally, for a given convex polygon
S
and a length
l
let's define a fiber shape
F(S,l)
as a set of points
t
such that the perimeter of the convex hull of
S∪{t}
does not exceed
l
. Find an area of
F(S,l)
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
l
(
3≤n≤
10
4
;
1≤l≤8⋅
10
5
) — the number of vertices of the polygon
S
and the length of the string. Next
n
lines contain integers
x
i
and
y
i
(

≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤

5
) — coordinates of polygon's vertices in counterclockwise order. All internal angles of the polygon are strictly less than
π
. The length
l
exceeds the perimeter of the polygon by at least
10
−3
.
Output
Output a single floating-point number — the area of the fiber shape
F(S,l)
. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed
10
−6
.
