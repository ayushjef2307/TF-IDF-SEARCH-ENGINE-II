Touko's favorite sequence of numbers is a permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of
1,2,…,n
, and she wants some collection of permutations that are similar to her favorite permutation.
She has a collection of
q
intervals of the form
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
with
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
. To create permutations that are similar to her favorite permutation, she coined the following definition:
A permutation
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
allows an interval
[
l
′
,
r
′
]
to holds its shape if for any pair of integers
(x,y)
such that
l
′
≤x<y≤
r
′
, we have
b
x
<
b
y
if and only if
a
x
<
a
y
.
A permutation
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
is
k
-similar if
b
allows all intervals
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
for all
1≤i≤k
to hold their shapes.
Yuu wants to figure out all
k
-similar permutations for Touko, but it turns out this is a very hard task; instead, Yuu will encode the set of all
k
-similar permutations with directed acylic graphs (DAG). Yuu also coined the following definitions for herself:
A permutation
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
satisfies a DAG
G
′
if for all edge
u→v
in
G
′
, we must have
b
u
<
b
v
.
A
k
-encoding is a DAG
G
k
on the set of vertices
1,2,…,n
such that a permutation
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
satisfies
G
k
if and only if
b
is
k
-similar.
Since Yuu is free today, she wants to figure out the minimum number of edges among all
k
-encodings for each
k
from
1
to
q
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n≤25000
,
1≤q≤100000
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
which form a permutation of
1,2,…,n
.
The
i
-th of the following
q
lines contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
. (
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
).
Output
Print
q
lines. The
k
-th of them should contain a single integer  — The minimum number of edges among all
k
-encodings.

Note
For the first test case:
All
1
-similar permutations must allow the interval
[1,3]
to hold its shape. Therefore, the set of all
1
-similar permutations is
{[3,4,2,1],[3,4,1,2],[2,4,1,3],[2,3,1,4]}
. The optimal encoding of these permutations is
All
2
-similar permutations must allow the intervals
[1,3]
and
[2,4]
to hold their shapes. Therefore, the set of all
2
-similar permutations is
{[3,4,1,2],[2,4,1,3]}
. The optimal encoding of these permutations is
All
3
-similar permutations must allow the intervals
[1,3]
,
[2,4]
, and
[1,4]
to hold their shapes. Therefore, the set of all
3
-similar permutations only includes
[2,4,1,3]
. The optimal encoding of this permutation is
