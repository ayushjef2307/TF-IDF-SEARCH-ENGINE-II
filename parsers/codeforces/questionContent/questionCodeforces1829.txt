As a teacher, Riko Hakozaki often needs to help her students with problems from various subjects. Today, she is asked a programming task which goes as follows.
You are given an undirected complete graph with
n
nodes, where some edges are pre-assigned with a positive weight while the rest aren't. You need to assign all unassigned edges with non-negative weights so that in the resulting fully-assigned complete graph the XOR sum of all weights would be equal to
0
.
Define the ugliness of a fully-assigned complete graph the weight of its minimum spanning tree, where the weight of a spanning tree equals the sum of weights of its edges. You need to assign the weights so that the ugliness of the resulting graph is as small as possible.
As a reminder, an undirected complete graph with
n
nodes contains all edges
(u,v)
with
1≤u<v≤n
; such a graph has
n(n−1)
2
edges.
She is not sure how to solve this problem, so she asks you to solve it for her.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
0≤m≤min(2⋅
10
5
,
n(n−1)
2
−1)
)  — the number of nodes and the number of pre-assigned edges. The inputs are given so that there is at least one unassigned edge.
The
i
-th of the following
m
lines contains three integers
u
i
,
v
i
, and
w
i
(
1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n
,
u≠v
,
1≤
w
i
<
2
30
), representing the edge from
u
i
to
v
i
has been pre-assigned with the weight
w
i
. No edge appears in the input more than once.
Output
Print on one line one integer  — the minimum ugliness among all weight assignments with XOR sum equal to
0
.

The following image showcases the first test case. The black weights are pre-assigned from the statement, the red weights are assigned by us, and the minimum spanning tree is denoted by the blue edges.
