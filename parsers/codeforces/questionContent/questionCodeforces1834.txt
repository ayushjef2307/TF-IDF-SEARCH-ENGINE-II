A permutation is a sequence of
n
integers from
1
to
n
, in which all numbers occur exactly once. For example,
[1]
,
[3,5,2,1,4]
,
[1,3,2]
are permutations, and
[2,3,2]
,
[4,3,1]
,
[0]
are not.
Polycarp was presented with a permutation
p
of numbers from
1
to
n
. However, when Polycarp came home, he noticed that in his pocket, the permutation
p
had turned into an array
q
according to the following rule:
q
i
=max(
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
i
)
.
Now Polycarp wondered what lexicographically minimal and lexicographically maximal permutations could be presented to him.
An array
a
of length
n
is lexicographically smaller than an array
b
of length
n
if there is an index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) such that the first
i−1
elements of arrays
a
and
b
are the same, and the
i
-th element of the array
a
is less than the
i
-th element of the array
b
. For example, the array
a=[1,3,2,3]
is lexicographically smaller than the array
b=[1,3,4,2]
.
For example, if
n=7
and
p=[3,2,4,1,7,5,6]
, then
q=[3,3,4,4,7,7,7]
and the following permutations could have been as
p
initially:
[3,1,4,2,7,5,6]
(lexicographically minimal permutation);
[3,1,4,2,7,6,5]
;
[3,2,4,1,7,5,6]
;
[3,2,4,1,7,6,5]
(lexicographically maximum permutation).
For a given array
q
, find the lexicographically minimal and lexicographically maximal permutations that could have been originally presented to Polycarp.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
q
1
,
q
2
,…,
q
n
(
1≤
q
i
≤n
).
It is guaranteed that the array
q
was obtained by applying the rule from the statement to some permutation
p
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output two lines:
on the first line output
n
integers — lexicographically minimal permutation that could have been originally presented to Polycarp;
on the second line print
n
integers — lexicographically maximal permutation that could have been originally presented to Polycarp;
