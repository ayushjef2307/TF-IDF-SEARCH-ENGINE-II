You are given a string
s
. You can reorder the characters to form a string
t
. Define
t
max
to be the lexicographical maximum of
t
and
t
in reverse order.
Given
s
determine the lexicographically minimum value of
t
max
over all reorderings
t
of
s
.
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
if and only if one of the following holds:
a
is a prefix of
b
, but
a≠b
;
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. Descriptions of test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains a string
s
(
1≤|s|≤
10
5
).
s
consists of only lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
|s|
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print the lexicographically minimum value of
t
max
over all reorderings
t
of
s
.

Note
For the first test case, there is only one reordering of
s
, namely "a".
For the second test case, there are three reorderings of
s
.
t=aab
:
t
max
=max(aab,baa)=baa
t=aba
:
t
max
=max(aba,aba)=aba
t=baa
:
t
max
=max(baa,aab)=baa
The lexicographical minimum of
t
max
over all cases is "aba".
