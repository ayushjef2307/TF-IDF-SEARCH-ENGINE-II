There are
n
cities numbered from
1
to
n
, and city
i
has beauty
a
i
.
A salesman wants to start at city
1
, visit every city exactly once, and return to city
1
.
For all
i≠j
, a flight from city
i
to city
j
costs
max(
c
i
,
a
j
−
a
i
)
dollars, where
c
i
is the price floor enforced by city
i
. Note that there is no absolute value. Find the minimum total cost for the salesman to complete his trip.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of cities.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains two integers
a
i
,
c
i
(
0≤
a
i
,
c
i
≤
10
9
) — the beauty and price floor of the
i
-th city.
Output
Output a single integer — the minimum total cost.

Note
In the first test case, we can travel in order
1→3→2→1
.
The flight
1→3
costs
max(
c
1
,
a
3
−
a
1
)=max(9,4−1)=9
.
The flight
3→2
costs
max(
c
3
,
a
2
−
a
3
)=max(1,2−4)=1
.
The flight
2→1
costs
max(
c
2
,
a
1
−
a
2
)=max(1,1−2)=1
.
The total cost is
11
, and we cannot do better.
