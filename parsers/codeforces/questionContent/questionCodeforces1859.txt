Vanya invented an interesting trick with a set of integers.
Let an illusionist have a set of positive integers
S
. He names a positive integer
x
. Then an audience volunteer must choose some subset (possibly, empty) of
S
without disclosing it to the illusionist. The volunteer tells the illusionist the size of the chosen subset. And here comes the trick: the illusionist guesses whether the sum of the subset elements does not exceed
x
. The sum of elements of an empty subset is considered to be
0
.
Vanya wants to prepare the trick for a public performance. He prepared some set of distinct positive integers
S
. Vasya wants the trick to be successful. He calls a positive number
x
unsuitable, if he can't be sure that the trick would be successful for every subset a viewer can choose.
Vanya wants to count the number of unsuitable integers for the chosen set
S
.
Vanya plans to try different sets
S
. He wants you to write a program that finds the number of unsuitable integers for the initial set
S
, and after each change to the set
S
. Vanya will make
q
changes to the set, and each change is one of the following two types:
add a new integer
a
to the set
S
, or
remove some integer
a
from the set
S
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
,
q
(
1≤n,q≤200000
) — the size of the initial set
S
and the number of changes.
The next line contains
n
distinct integers
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
n
(
1≤
s
i
≤
10
13
) — the initial elements of
S
.
Each of the following
q
lines contain two integers
t
i
,
a
i
(
1≤
t
i
≤2
,
1≤
a
i
≤
10
13
), describing a change:
If
t
i
=1
, then an integer
a
i
is added to the set
S
. It is guaranteed that this integer is not present in
S
before this operation.
If
t
i
=2
, then an integer
a
i
is removed from the set
S
. In is guaranteed that this integer is present in
S
before this operation.
Output
Print
q+1
lines.
In the first line print the number of unsuitable integers for the initial set
S
. In the next
q
lines print the number of unsuitable integers for
S
after each change.

Note
In the first example the initial set is
S={1,2,3}
. For this set the trick can be unsuccessful for
x∈{1,2,3,4}
. For example, if
x=4
, the volunteer can choose the subset
{1,2}
with sum
3≤x
, and can choose the subset
{2,3}
with sum
5>x
. However, in both cases the illusionist only know the same size of the subset (
2
), so he can't be sure answering making a guess. Since there is only one subset of size
3
, and the sum of each subset of smaller size does not exceed
5
, all
x≥5
are suitable.
