Alice and Bob are going to celebrate Christmas by playing a game with a tree of presents. The tree has
n
nodes (numbered
1
to
n
, with some node
r
as its root). There are
a
i
presents are hanging from the
i
-th node.
Before beginning the game, a special integer
k
is chosen. The game proceeds as follows:
Alice begins the game, with moves alternating each turn;
in any move, the current player may choose some node (for example,
i
) which has depth at least
k
. Then, the player picks some positive number of presents hanging from that node, let's call it
m
(1≤m≤
a
i
)
;
the player then places these
m
presents on the
k
-th ancestor (let's call it
j
) of the
i
-th node (the
k
-th ancestor of vertex
i
is a vertex
j
such that
i
is a descendant of
j
, and the difference between the depth of
j
and the depth of
i
is exactly
k
). Now, the number of presents of the
i
-th node
(
a
i
)
is decreased by
m
, and, correspondingly,
a
j
is increased by
m
;
Alice and Bob both play optimally. The player unable to make a move loses the game.
For each possible root of the tree, find who among Alice or Bob wins the game.
Note: The depth of a node
i
in a tree with root
r
is defined as the number of edges on the simple path from node
r
to node
i
. The depth of root
r
itself is zero.
Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers
n
and
k
(3≤n≤
10
5
,1≤k≤20)
.
The next
n−1
lines each contain two integers
x
and
y
(1≤x,y≤n,x≠y)
, denoting an undirected edge between the two nodes
x
and
y
. These edges form a tree of
n
nodes.
The next line contains
n
space-separated integers denoting the array
a
(0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
)
.
Output
Output
n
integers, where the
i
-th integer is
1
if Alice wins the game when the tree is rooted at node
i
, or
0
otherwise.

Note
Let us calculate the answer for sample input with root node as 1 and as 2.
Root node 1
Alice always wins in this case. One possible gameplay between Alice and Bob is:
Alice moves one present from node 4 to node 3.
Bob moves four presents from node 5 to node 2.
Alice moves four presents from node 2 to node 1.
Bob moves three presents from node 2 to node 1.
Alice moves three presents from node 3 to node 1.
Bob moves three presents from node 4 to node 3.
Alice moves three presents from node 3 to node 1.
Bob is now unable to make a move and hence loses.
Root node 2
Bob always wins in this case. One such gameplay is:
Alice moves four presents from node 4 to node 3.
Bob moves four presents from node 5 to node 2.
Alice moves six presents from node 3 to node 1.
Bob moves six presents from node 1 to node 2.
Alice is now unable to make a move and hence loses.
