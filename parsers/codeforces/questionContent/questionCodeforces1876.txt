The
gcdSum
of a positive integer is the
gcd
of that integer with its sum of digits. Formally,
gcdSum(x)=gcd(x, sum of digits of x)
for a positive integer
x
.
gcd(a,b)
denotes the greatest common divisor of
a
and
b
— the largest integer
d
such that both integers
a
and
b
are divisible by
d
.
For example:
gcdSum(762)=gcd(762,7+6+2)=gcd(762,15)=3
.
Given an integer
n
, find the smallest integer
x≥n
such that
gcdSum(x)>1
.
Input
The first line of input contains one integer
t
(1≤t≤
10
4
)
— the number of test cases.
Then
t
lines follow, each containing a single integer
n
(1≤n≤
10
18
)
.
All test cases in one test are different.
Output
Output
t
lines, where the
i
-th line is a single integer containing the answer to the
i
-th test case.

Note
Let us explain the three test cases in the sample.
Test case 1:
n=11
:
gcdSum(11)=gcd(11,1+1)=gcd(11, 2)=1
.
gcdSum(12)=gcd(12,1+2)=gcd(12, 3)=3
.
So the smallest number
≥11
whose
gcdSum
>1
is
12
.
Test case 2:
n=31
:
gcdSum(31)=gcd(31,3+1)=gcd(31, 4)=1
.
gcdSum(32)=gcd(32,3+2)=gcd(32, 5)=1
.
gcdSum(33)=gcd(33,3+3)=gcd(33, 6)=3
.
So the smallest number
≥31
whose
gcdSum
>1
is
33
.
Test case 3:
 n=75
:
gcdSum(75)=gcd(75,7+5)=gcd(75, 12)=3
.
The
gcdSum
of
75
is already
>1
. Hence, it is the answer.
