There are
n
problems numbered with integers from
1
to
n
.
i
-th problem has the complexity
c

After solving the problem

it's allowed to solve problem

Any problem can be the first. You can solve problems in any order and as many times as you want.
Initially your
IQ=0
. Find the maximum number of points that can be earned.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤100)
 — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(1≤n≤5000)
 — the number of problems.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers

Output
For each test case print a single integer  — the maximum number of points that can be earned.

IQ=4
3→1
, after that total score is
20
and
IQ=6
1→4
, after that total score is
35
and
IQ=14
In the second test case optimal sequence of solving problems is as follows:
1→2
, after that total score is
