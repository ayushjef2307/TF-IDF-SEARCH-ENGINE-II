Grandfather Ahmed's School has
n+1
students. The students are divided into
k
classes, and
s
i
students study in the
i
-th class. So,
s
1
+
s
2
+…+
s
k
=n+1
.
Due to the upcoming April Fools' Day, all students will receive gifts!
Grandfather Ahmed planned to order
n+1
boxes of gifts. Each box can contain one or more gifts. He plans to distribute the boxes between classes so that the following conditions are satisfied:
Class number
i
receives exactly
s
i
boxes (so that each student can open exactly one box).
The total number of gifts in the boxes received by the
i
-th class should be a multiple of
s
i
(it should be possible to equally distribute the gifts among the
s
i
students of this class).
Unfortunately, Grandfather Ahmed ordered only
n
boxes with gifts, the
i
-th of which contains
a
i
gifts.
Ahmed has to buy the missing gift box, and the number of gifts in the box should be an integer between
1
and
10
6
. Help Ahmed to determine, how many gifts should the missing box contain, and build a suitable distribution of boxes to classes, or report that this is impossible.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n,k≤200
,
k≤n+1
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
6
) — the number of gifts in the available boxes.
The third line contains
k
integers
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
k
(
1≤
s
i
≤n+1
) — the number of students in classes. It is guaranteed that
∑
s
i
=n+1
.
Output
If there is no way to buy the remaining box, output the integer
−1
in a single line.
Otherwise, in the first line, output a single integer
s
 — the number of gifts in the box that Grandfather Ahmed should buy (
1≤s≤
10
6
).
Next, in
k
lines, print the distribution of boxes to classes. In the
i
-th line print
s
i
integers — the sizes of the boxes that should be sent to the
i
-th class.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Note
In the first test, Grandfather Ahmed can buy a box with just
1
gift. After that, two boxes with
7
gifts are sent to the first class.
7+7=14
is divisible by
2
. And the second class gets boxes with
1,7,127
gifts.
1+7+127=135
is evenly divisible by
3
.
In the second test, the classes have sizes
6
,
1
,
9
, and
3
. We show that the available boxes are enough to distribute into classes with sizes
6
,
9
,
3
, and in the class with size
1
, you can buy a box of any size. In class with size
6
we send boxes with sizes
7
,
1
,
7
,
6
,
5
,
4
.
7+1+7+6+5+4=30
is divisible by
6
. In class with size
9
we send boxes with sizes
1
,
2
,
3
,
8
,
3
,
2
,
9
,

,

.
1+2+3+8+3+2+9+8+9=45
is divisible by
9
. The remaining boxes (
6
,
5
,
4
) are sent to the class with size
3
.
6+5+4=15
is divisible by
3
.
