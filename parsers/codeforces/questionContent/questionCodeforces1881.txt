It is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version
k=3
.
You are given a positive integer
n
. Find
k
positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
k
, such that:
a
1
+
a
2
+…+
a
k
=n
LCM(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
k
)≤
n
2
Here
LCM
is the least common multiple of numbers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
k
.
We can show that for given constraints the answer always exists.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤
10
4
)
 — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
n
,
k
(
3≤n≤
10

,
k=3
).
Output
For each test case print
k
positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
k
, for which all conditions are satisfied.
