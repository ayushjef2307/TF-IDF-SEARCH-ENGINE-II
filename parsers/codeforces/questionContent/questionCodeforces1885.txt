Kawashiro Nitori is a girl who loves competitive programming.
One day she found a string and an integer. As an advanced problem setter, she quickly thought of a problem.
Given a string
s
and a parameter
k
, you need to check if there exist
k+1
non-empty strings
a
1
,
a
2
...,
a
k+1
, such that
s=
a
1
+
a
2
+…+
a
k
+
a
k+1
+R(
a
k
)+R(
a
k−1
)+…+R(
a
1
).
R

Here
+
represents concatenation. We define
R(x)
as a reversed string
x
. For example
R(abcd)=dcba
. Note that in the formula above the part
R(
a
k+1
)
is intentionally skipped.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case description contains two integers
n
,
k
(
1≤n≤100
,
0≤k≤⌊
n
2
⌋
)  — the length of the string
s
and the parameter
k
.
The second line of each test case description contains a single string
s
of length
n
, consisting of lowercase English letters.
Output
For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes), if it is possible to find
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
k+1
, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).
