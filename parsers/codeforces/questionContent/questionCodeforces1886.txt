There are
n
squares drawn from left to right on the floor. The
i
-th square has three integers
p
i
,
a
i
,
b
i
, written on it. The sequence
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
forms a permutation.
Each round you will start from the leftmost square
1
and jump to the right. If you are now on the
i
-th square, you can do one of the following two operations:
Jump to the
i+1
-th square and pay the cost
a
i
. If
i=n
, then you can end the round and pay the cost
a
i
.
Jump to the
j
-th square and pay the cost
b
i
, where
j
is the leftmost square that satisfies
j>i,
p
j
>
p
i
. If there is no such
j
then you can end the round and pay the cost
b
i
.
There are
q
rounds in the game. To make the game more difficult, you need to maintain a square set
S
(initially it is empty). You must pass through these squares during the round (other squares can also be passed through). The square set
S
for the
i
-th round is obtained by adding or removing a square from the square set for the
(i−1)
-th round.
For each round find the minimum cost you should pay to end it.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
,
q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅
10
5
)  — the number of squares and the number of rounds.
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
). It is guaranteed that the sequence
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
forms a permutation.
The third line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
The fourth line contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
−
10
9
≤
b
i
≤
10
9
).
Then
q
lines follow,
i
-th of them contains a single integer
x
i
(
1≤
x
i
≤n
). If
x
i
was in the set
S
on the
(i−1)
-th round you should remove it, otherwise, you should add it.
Output
Print
q
lines, each of them should contain a single integer  — the minimum cost you should pay to end the corresponding round.

Note
Let's consider the character
T
as the end of a round. Then we can draw two graphs for the first and the second test.
In the first round of the first test, the set that you must pass through is
{1}
. The path you can use is
1→3→T
and its cost is
6
.
In the second round of the first test, the set that you must pass through is
{1,2}
. The path you can use is
1→2→3→T
and its cost is
8
.
