On a weekend, Qingshan suggests that she and her friend Daniel go hiking. Unfortunately, they are busy high school students, so they can only go hiking on scratch paper.
A permutation
p
is written from left to right on the paper. First Qingshan chooses an integer index
x
(
1≤x≤n
) and tells it to Daniel. After that, Daniel chooses another integer index
y
(
1≤y≤n
,
y≠x
).
The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Qingshan moves first. The rules follow:
If it is Qingshan's turn, Qingshan must change
x
to such an index
x
′
that
1≤
x
′
≤n
,
|
x
′
−x|=1
,
x
′
≠y
, and
p
x
′
<
p
x
at the same time.
If it is Daniel's turn, Daniel must change
y
to such an index
y
′
that
1≤
y
′
≤n
,
|
y
′
−y|=1
,
y
′
≠x
, and
p
y
′
>
p
y
at the same time.
The person who can't make her or his move loses, and the other wins. You, as Qingshan's fan, are asked to calculate the number of possible
x
to make Qingshan win in the case both players play optimally.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the permutation.
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — the permutation.
Output
Print the number of possible values of
x
that Qingshan can choose to make her win.

Note
In the first test case, Qingshan can only choose
x=3
to win, so the answer is
1
.
In the second test case, if Qingshan will choose
x=4
, Daniel can choose
y=1
. In the first turn (Qingshan's) Qingshan chooses
x
′
=3
and changes
x
to
3
. In the second turn (Daniel's) Daniel chooses
y
′
=2
and changes
y
to
2
. Qingshan can't choose
x
′
=2
because
y=2
at this time. Then Qingshan loses.
