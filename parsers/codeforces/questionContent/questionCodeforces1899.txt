You are given two integers
l
and
r
in binary representation. Let
g(x,y)
be equal to the bitwise XOR of all integers from
x
to
y
inclusive (that is
x⊕(x+1)⊕⋯⊕(y−1)⊕y
). Let's define
f(l,r)
as the maximum of all values of
g(x,y)
satisfying
l≤x≤y≤r
.
Output
f(l,r)
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
6
) — the length of the binary representation of
r
.
The second line contains the binary representation of
l
— a string of length
n
consisting of digits
0
and
1
(
0≤l<
2
n
).
The third line contains the binary representation of
r
— a string of length
n
consisting of digits
0
and
1
(
0≤r<
2
n
).
It is guaranteed that
l≤r
. The binary representation of
r
does not contain any extra leading zeros (if
r=0
, the binary representation of it consists of a single zero). The binary representation of
l
is preceded with leading zeros so that its length is equal to
n
.
Output
In a single line output the value of
f(l,r)
for the given pair of
l
and
r
in binary representation without extra leading zeros.
