You are given an array
a
of length
n
. You are asked to process
q
queries of the following format: given integers
i
and
x
, multiply
a
i
by
x
.
After processing each query you need to output the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements of the array
a
.
Since the answer can be too large, you are asked to output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The first line contains two integers —
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤2⋅
10
5
) — the elements of the array
a
before the changes.
The next
q
lines contain queries in the following format: each line contains two integers
i
and
x
(
1≤i≤n
,
1≤x≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
Print
q
lines: after processing each query output the GCD of all elements modulo
10
9
+7
on a separate line.

Note
After the first query the array is
[12,6,8,12]
,
gcd(12,6,8,12)=2
.
After the second query —
[12,18,8,12]
,
gcd(12,18,8,12)=2
.
After the third query —
[12,18,24,12]
,
gcd(12,18,24,12)=6
.
Here the
gcd
function denotes the greatest common divisor.
