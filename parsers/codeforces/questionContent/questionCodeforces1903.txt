You are given two integers
n
and
k
. You are asked to choose maximum number of distinct integers from
1
to
n
so that there is no subset of chosen numbers with sum equal to
k
.
A subset of a set is a set that can be obtained from initial one by removing some (possibly all or none) elements of it.
Input
The first line contains the number of test cases
T
(
1≤T≤100
).
Each of the next
T
lines contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤1000
) — the description of test cases.
Output
For each test case output two lines. In the first line output a single integer
m
— the number of chosen integers.
In the second line output
m
distinct integers from
1
to
n
— the chosen numbers.
If there are multiple answers, print any. You can print the numbers in any order.
