Yuezheng Ling gives Luo Tianyi a tree which has
n
nodes, rooted at
1
.
Luo Tianyi will tell you that the parent of the
i
-th node is
a
i
(
1≤
a
i
<i
for
2≤i≤n
), and she will ask you to perform
q
queries of
2
types:
She'll give you three integers
l
,
r
and
x
(
2≤l≤r≤n
,
1≤x≤
10
5
). You need to replace
a
i
with
max(
a
i
−x,1)
for all
i
with
l≤i≤r
.
She'll give you two integers
u
,
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
). You need to find the LCA of nodes
u
and
v
(their lowest common ancestor).
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n,q≤
10
5
) — the number of nodes and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line contains
n−1
integers
a
2
,
a
3
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
<i
), where
a
i
is the parent of the node
i
.
Next
q
lines contain queries. For each query, the first integer of each line is
t
(
t=1
or
2
) — the type of the query.
If
t=1
, this represents the query of the first type. Then, three integers will follow:
l
,
r
,
x
(
2≤l≤r≤n
,
1≤x≤
10
5
), meaning that you have to replace
a
i
with
max(
a
i
−x,1)
for all
i
with
l≤i≤r
.
If
t=2
, this represents the query of the second type. Then, two integers will follow:
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
), and you have to find the LCA of
u
and
v
.
It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type.
Output
For each query of the second type output answer on a new line.

Note
The tree in example is shown below.
After the query of the first type, the tree changes and is looking as shown below.
