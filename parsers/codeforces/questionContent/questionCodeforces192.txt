Lottery "Three Sevens" was held for
m
days. On day
i
,
n
i
people with the numbers
a
i,1
,…,
a
i,
n
i
participated in the lottery.
It is known that in each of the
m
days, only one winner was selected from the lottery participants. The lottery winner on day
i
was not allowed to participate in the lottery in the days from
i+1
to
m
.
Unfortunately, the information about the lottery winners has been lost. You need to find any possible list of lottery winners on days from
1
to
m
or determine that no solution exists.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤50000
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
m
(
1≤m≤50000
) — the number of days in which the lottery was held.
Next, for each
i
from
1
to
m
, follows a two-line block of data.
The first line of each block contains a single integer
n
i
(
1≤
n
i
≤50000
) — the number of lottery participants on day
i
.
The second line of the block contains integers
a
i,1
,…,
a
i,
n
i
(
1≤
a
i,j
≤50000
) — lottery participants on day
i
. It is guaranteed that all the numbers
a
i,1
,…,
a
i,
n
i
are pairwise distinct.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
i
over all blocks of all test cases does not exceed
50000
.
Output
For each test case, if there is no solution, print a single integer
−1
.
Otherwise, print
m
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
m
(
1≤
p
i
≤50000
) — lottery winners on days from
1
to
m
. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

Note
In the first test case, one of the answers is
[8,2,1]
since the participant with the number
8
participated on day
1
, but did not participate on days
2
and
3
; the participant with the number
2
participated on day
2
, but did not participate on day
3
; and the participant with the number
1
participated on day
3
. Note that this is not the only possible answer, for example,
[8,9,4]
is also a correct answer.
In the second test case, both lottery participants participated on both days, so any possible lottery winner on the day
1
must have participated on the day
2
, which is not allowed. Thus, there is no correct answer.
In the third test case, only one participant participated on days
2
,
3
,
4
, and on day
1
there is only one participant who did not participate in the lottery on days
2,3,4
 — participant
2
, which means
[2,1,4,3]
is the only correct answer to this test case.
