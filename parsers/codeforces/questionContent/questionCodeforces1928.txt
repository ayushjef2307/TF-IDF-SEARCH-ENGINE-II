Recently, cryptocurrencies have become increasingly popular. Ann decided that it was about time she started mining the Dogecoin cryptocurrency. Ann's computer is not very powerful, so Ann mines exactly
1
Dogecoin per day. On the Internet, there are forecasts of the cost of
1
dogecoin for the next
n
days. Every day, Ann can sell any amount of dogecoin that she currently has. Note that if Ann mined Dogecoin on the
i
-th day, then she can sell it on the same day.
Ann has not yet decided when to start mining. She has prepared
q
possible plans and for each of them wants to know the maximum profit that she can get. Each of the plans is described by two numbers
l
and
r
— the first and last days of mining. Note that Ann should not have any Dogecoin left after the
r
-th day.

10
6
), where
c
i
is the cost of Dogecoin on the

-th day.
The third line contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅
10
