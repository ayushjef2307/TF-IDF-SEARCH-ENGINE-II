A subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
A palindromic sequence is a sequence that is equal to the reverse of itself.
You are given a sequence of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. Any integer value appears in
a
no more than twice.
What is the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of sequence
a
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of testcases.
Then the descriptions of
t
testcases follow.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤250000
) — the number of elements in the sequence.
The second line of each testcase contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
).
Any integer value appears in
a
no more than twice. The sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
250000
.
Output
For each testcase print a single integer — the length of the longest palindromic subsequence of sequence
a
.
