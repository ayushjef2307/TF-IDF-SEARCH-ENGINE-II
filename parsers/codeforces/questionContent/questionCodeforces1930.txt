Polycarp has decided to do a problemsolving marathon. He wants to solve
s
problems in
n
days. Let
a
i
be the number of problems he solves during the
i
-th day. He wants to find a distribution of problems into days such that:
a
i
is an integer value for all
i
from
1
to
n
;
a
i
≥1
for all
i
from
1
to
n
;
a
i+1
≥
a
i
for all
i
from
1
to
n−1
;
a
i+1
≤2⋅
a
i
for all
i
from
1
to
n−1
;
a
n
is maximized.
Note that
a
1
can be arbitrarily large.
What is the largest value of
a
n
Polycarp can obtain?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of testcases.
Then the descriptions of
t
testcases follow.
The only line of each testcase contains two integers
n
and
s
(
1≤n≤s≤
10
18
) — the number of days and the number of problems Polycarp wants to solve.
It's guaranteed that the distribution always exists within the given constraints.
Output
For each testcase print a single integer — the maximum value of
a
n
.

Note
In the first testcase there is only one distribution:
[15]
.
In the second testcase the distribution that maximizes
a
n
is:
[2,3,4]
.
In the third testcase the distribution that maximizes
a
n
is:
[2,4]
.
[3,3]
is a valid distribution but
a
n
=3
which is smaller than
4
.
[1,5]
is not a valid distribution because
5>2⋅1
.
