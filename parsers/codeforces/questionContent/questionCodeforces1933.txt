You are given two positive (greater than zero) integers
x
and
y
. There is a variable
k
initially set to
0
.
You can perform the following two types of operations:
add
1
to
k
(i. e. assign
k:=k+1
);
add
x⋅
10
p
to
k
for some non-negative
p
(i. e. assign
k:=k+x⋅
10
p
for some
p≥0
).
Find the minimum number of operations described above to set the value of
k
to
y
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing two integer
x
and
y
(
1≤x,y≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations to set the value of
k
to
y
.
