You are given a positive (greater than zero) integer
n
.
You have to represent
n
as the sum of integers (possibly negative) consisting only of ones (digits '1'). For example,
24=11+11+1+1
and
102=111−11+1+1
.
Among all possible representations, you have to find the one that uses the minimum number of ones in total.
Input
The single line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n<
10
50
).
Output
Print one integer
x
— the minimum number of ones, such that there exist a representation of
n
as the sum of integers (possibly negative) that uses
x
ones in total.
