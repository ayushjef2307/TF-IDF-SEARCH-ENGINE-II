A Pythagorean triple is a triple of integer numbers
(a,b,c)
such that it is possible to form a right triangle with the lengths of the first cathetus, the second cathetus and the hypotenuse equal to
a
,
b
and
c
, respectively. An example of the Pythagorean triple is
(3,4,5)
.
Vasya studies the properties of right triangles, and he uses a formula that determines if some triple of integers is Pythagorean. Unfortunately, he has forgotten the exact formula; he remembers only that the formula was some equation with squares. So, he came up with the following formula:
c=
a
2
−b
.
Obviously, this is not the right formula to check if a triple of numbers is Pythagorean. But, to Vasya's surprise, it actually worked on the triple
(3,4,5)
:
5=
3
2
−4
, so, according to Vasya's formula, it is a Pythagorean triple.
When Vasya found the right formula (and understood that his formula is wrong), he wondered: how many are there triples of integers
(a,b,c)
with
1≤a≤b≤c≤n
such that they are Pythagorean both according to his formula and the real definition? He asked you to count these triples.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the number of triples of integers
(a,b,c)
with
1≤a≤b≤c≤n
such that they are Pythagorean according both to the real definition and to the formula Vasya came up with.

Note
The only Pythagorean triple satisfying
c=
a
2
−b
with
1≤a≤b≤c≤9
is
(3,4,5)
; that's why the answer for
n=3
is
0
, and the answer for
n=6
(and for
n=9
) is
1
.
