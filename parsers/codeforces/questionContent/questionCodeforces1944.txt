outputstandard output
The only difference between the easy and the hard version is the limit to the number of queries.
This is an interactive problem.
There is an array
a
of
n
different numbers. In one query you can ask the position of the second maximum element in a subsegment
a[l..r]
. Find the position of the maximum element in the array in no more than 20 queries.
A subsegment
a[l..r]
is all the elements
a
l
,
a
l+1
,...,
a
r
. After asking this subsegment you will be given the position of the second maximum from this subsegment in the whole array.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(2≤n≤
10
5
)
— the number of elements in the array.
Interaction
You can ask queries by printing "?
l
r
"
(1≤l<r≤n)
. The answer is the index of the second maximum of all elements
a
l
,
a
l+1
,...,
a
r
. Array
a
is fixed beforehand and can't be changed in time of interaction.
You can output the answer by printing "!
p
", where
p
is the index of the maximum element in the array.
You can ask no more than 20 queries. Printing the answer doesn't count as a query.
After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:
fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
flush(output) in Pascal;
stdout.flush() in Python;
see documentation for other languages
Hacks
To make a hack, use the following test format.
In the first line output a single integer
n
(2≤n≤
10
5
)
. In the second line output a permutation of
n
integers
1
to
n
. The position of
n
in the permutation is the position of the maximum
Example
input
Copy
5

3

4
output
Copy
? 1 5

? 4 5

! 1
Note
In the sample suppose
a
is
[5,1,4,2,3]
. So after asking the
[1..5]
subsegment
4
is second to max value, and it's position is
3
. After asking the
[4..5]
subsegment
2
is second to max value and it's position in the whole array is
4
.
Note that there are other arrays
a
that would produce the same interaction, and the answer for them might be different. Example output is given in purpose of understanding the interaction.
