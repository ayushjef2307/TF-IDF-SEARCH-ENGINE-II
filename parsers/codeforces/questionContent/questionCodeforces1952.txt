Given a positive integer
k
, two arrays are called
k
-similar if:
they are strictly increasing;
they have the same length;
all their elements are positive integers between
1
and
k
(inclusive);
they differ in exactly one position.
You are given an integer
k
, a strictly increasing array
a
and
q
queries. For each query, you are given two integers
l
i
≤
r
i
. Your task is to find how many arrays
b
exist, such that
b
is
k
-similar to array
[
a
l
i
,
a
l
i
+1
…,
a
r
i
]
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
q
and
k
(
1≤n,q≤
10
5
,
n≤k≤
10
9
) — the length of array
a
, the number of queries and number
k
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤k
). This array is strictly increasing  —
a
1
<
a
2
<…<
a
n
.
Each of the following
q
lines contains two integers
l
i
,
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
).
Output
Print
q
lines. The
i
-th of them should contain the answer to the
i
-th query.

Note
In the first example:
In the first query there are
4
arrays that are
5
-similar to
[2,4]
:
[1,4],[3,4],[2,3],[2,5]
.
In the second query there are
3
arrays that are
5
-similar to
[4,5]
:
[1,5],[2,5],[3,5]
.
