Note
In the first example hidan fights against dan, and hanabi fights against nabi, who also fights bi. Ninjas named hanabi and bi don't fight each other since there is the ninja called nabi who breaks the third condition for them.
In the second example the fights are held between abacaba and acaba, abacaba and abaca, acaba and aca, abaca and aca.
