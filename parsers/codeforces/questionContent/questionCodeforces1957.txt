Alice is visiting New York City. To make the trip fun, Alice will take photos of the city skyline and give the set of photos as a present to Bob. However, she wants to find the set of photos with maximum beauty and she needs your help.
There are
n
buildings in the city, the
i
-th of them has positive height
h
i
. All
n
building heights in the city are different. In addition, each building has a beauty value
b
i
. Note that beauty can be positive or negative, as there are ugly buildings in the city too.
A set of photos consists of one or more photos of the buildings in the skyline. Each photo includes one or more buildings in the skyline that form a contiguous segment of indices. Each building needs to be in exactly one photo. This means that if a building does not appear in any photo, or if a building appears in more than one photo, the set of pictures is not valid.
The beauty of a photo is equivalent to the beauty
b
i
of the shortest building in it. The total beauty of a set of photos is the sum of the beauty of all photos in it. Help Alice to find the maximum beauty a valid set of photos can have.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤3⋅
10
5
), the number of buildings on the skyline.
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
h
1
,
h
2
,…,
h
n
(
1≤
h
i
≤n
). The
i
-th number represents the height of building
i
.
The third line contains
n
integers
b

b
2
,…,

n
(

≤
b
i
≤

). The
i
-th number represents the beauty of building
i
.
Output
Print one number representing the maximum beauty Alice can achieve for a valid set of photos of the skyline.
