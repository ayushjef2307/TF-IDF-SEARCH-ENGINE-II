Kilani and Abd are neighbors for 3000 years, but then the day came and Kilani decided to move to another house. As a farewell gift, Kilani is going to challenge Abd with a problem written by their other neighbor with the same name Abd.
The problem is:
You are given a connected tree rooted at node
1
.
You should assign a character a or b to every node in the tree so that the total number of a's is equal to
x
and the total number of b's is equal to
n−x
.
Let's define a string for each node
v
of the tree as follows:
if
v
is root then the string is just one character assigned to
v
:
otherwise, let's take a string defined for the
v
's parent
p
v
and add to the end of it a character assigned to
v
.
You should assign every node a character in a way that minimizes the number of distinct strings among the strings of all nodes.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
x
(
1≤n≤
10
5
;
0≤x≤n
) — the number of vertices in the tree the number of a's.
The second line contains
n−1
integers
p
2
,
p
3
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
;
p
i
≠i
), where
p
i
is the parent of node
i
.
It is guaranteed that the input describes a connected tree.
Output
In the first line, print the minimum possible total number of distinct strings.
In the second line, print
n
characters, where all characters are either a or b and the
i
-th character is the character assigned to the
i
-th node.
Make sure that the total number of a's is equal to
x
and the total number of b's is equal to
n−x
.
If there is more than one answer you can print any of them.

Note
The tree from the sample is shown below:
The tree after assigning characters to every node (according to the output) is the following:
Strings for all nodes are the following:
string of node
1
is: a
string of node
2
is: aa
string of node
3
is: aab
string of node
4
is: aab
string of node
5
is: aabb
string of node
6
is: aabb
string of node
7
is: aabb
string of node
8
is: aabb
string of node
9
is: aa
The set of unique strings is
{a,aa,aab,aabb}
, so the number of distinct strings is
4
.
