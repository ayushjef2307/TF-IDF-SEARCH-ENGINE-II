Note
In the first example, we have the bookshelf
[1,2,2,1,3]
and can, for example:
take a book on position
4
and move to the right end: we'll get
[1,2,2,3,1]
;
take a book on position
1
and move to the right end: we'll get
[2,2,3,1,1]
.
In the second example, we can move the first book to the end of the bookshelf and get
[2,2,1,1,1]
.
