The only difference between the two versions is that this version asks the maximal possible answer.
Homer likes arrays a lot. Today he is painting an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
with two kinds of colors, white and black. A painting assignment for
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
is described by an array
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
that
b
i
indicates the color of
a
i
(
0
for white and
1
for black).
According to a painting assignment
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
, the array
a
is split into two new arrays
a
(0)
and
a
(1)
, where
a
(0)
is the sub-sequence of all white elements in
a
and
a
(1)
is the sub-sequence of all black elements in
a
. For example, if
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
and
b=[0,1,0,1,0,0]
, then
a
(0)
=[1,3,5,6]
and
a
(1)
=[2,4]
.
The number of segments in an array
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
k
, denoted
seg(c)
, is the number of elements if we merge all adjacent elements with the same value in
c
. For example, the number of segments in
[1,1,2,2,3,3,3,2]
is
4
, because the array will become
[1,2,3,2]
after merging adjacent elements with the same value. Especially, the number of segments in an empty array is
0
.
Homer wants to find a painting assignment
b
, according to which the number of segments in both
a
(0)
and
a
(1)
, i.e.
seg(
a
(0)
)+seg(
a
(1)
)
, is as large as possible. Find this number.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
).
Output
Output a single integer, indicating the maximal possible total number of segments.

Note
In the first example, we can choose
a
(0)
=[1,2,3,3]
,
a
(1)
=[1,2,3]
and
seg(
a
(0)
)=seg(
a
(1)
)=3
. So the answer is
3+3=6
.
In the second example, we can choose
a
(0)
=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
and
a
(1)
is empty. We can see that
seg(
a
(0)
)=7
and
seg(
a
(1)
)=0
. So the answer is
7+0=7
.
