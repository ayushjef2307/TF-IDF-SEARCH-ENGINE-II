Nezzar designs a brand new game "Hidden Permutations" and shares it with his best friend, Nanako.
At the beginning of the game, Nanako and Nezzar both know integers
n
and
m
. The game goes in the following way:
Firstly, Nezzar hides two permutations
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
and
q
1
,
q
2
,…,
q
n
of integers from
1
to
n
, and Nanako secretly selects
m
unordered pairs
(
l
1
,
r
1
),(
l
2
,
r
2
),…,(
l
m
,
r
m
)
;
After that, Nanako sends his chosen pairs to Nezzar;
On receiving those
m
unordered pairs, Nezzar checks if there exists
1≤i≤m
, such that
(
p
l
i
−
p
r
i
)
and
(
q
l
i
−
q
r
i
)
have different signs. If so, Nezzar instantly loses the game and gets a score of
−1
. Otherwise, the score Nezzar gets is equal to the number of indices
1≤i≤n
such that
p
i
≠
q
i
.
However, Nezzar accidentally knows Nanako's unordered pairs and decides to take advantage of them. Please help Nezzar find out two permutations
p
and
q
such that the score is maximized.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤5⋅
10
5
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n,m
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
,0≤m≤min(
n(n−1)
2
,5⋅
10
5
)
).
Then
m
lines follow,
i
-th of them contains two integers
l
i
,
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
,
r
i
≤n
,
l
i
≠
r
i
), describing the
i
-th unordered pair Nanako chooses. It is guaranteed that all
m
unordered pairs are distinct.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
for all test cases does not exceed
5⋅
10
5
, and the sum of
m
for all test cases does not exceed
5⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print two permutations
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
and
q
1
,
q
2
,…,
q
n
such that the score Nezzar gets is maximized.

Note
For first test case, for each pair given by Nanako:
for the first pair
(1,2)
:
p
1
−
p
2
=1−2=−1
,
q
1
−
q
2
=3−4=−1
, they have the same sign;
for the second pair
(3,4)
:
p
3
−
p
4
=3−4=−1
,
q
3
−
q
4
=1−2=−1
, they have the same sign.
As Nezzar does not lose instantly, Nezzar gains the score of
4
as
p
i
≠
q
i
for all
1≤i≤4
. Obviously, it is the maximum possible score Nezzar can get.
