Igor had a sequence
d
1
,
d
2
,…,
d
n
of integers. When Igor entered the classroom there was an integer
x
written on the blackboard.
Igor generated sequence
p
using the following algorithm:
initially,
p=[x]
;
for each
1≤i≤n
he did the following operation
|
d
i
|
times:
if
d
i
≥0
, then he looked at the last element of
p
(let it be
y
) and appended
y+1
to the end of
p
;
if
d
i
<0
, then he looked at the last element of
p
(let it be
y
) and appended
y−1
to the end of
p
.
For example, if
x=3
, and
d=[1,−1,2]
,
p
will be equal
[3,4,3,4,5]
.
Igor decided to calculate the length of the longest increasing subsequence of
p
and the number of them.
A sequence
a
is a subsequence of a sequence
b
if
a
can be obtained from
b
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
A sequence
a
is an increasing sequence if each element of
a
(except the first one) is strictly greater than the previous element.
For
p=[3,4,3,4,5]
, the length of longest increasing subsequence is
3
and there are
3
of them:
[
3
–
,
4
–
,3,4,
5
–
]
,
[
3
–
,4,3,
4
–
,
5
–
]
,
[3,4,
3
–
,
4
–
,
5
–
]
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤50
) — the length of the sequence
d
.
The second line contains a single integer
x
(
−
10
9
≤x≤
10
9
) — the integer on the blackboard.
The third line contains
n
integers
d
1
,
d
2
,…,
d
n
(
−
10
9
≤
d
i
≤
10
9
).
Output
Print two integers:
the first integer should be equal to the length of the longest increasing subsequence of
p
;
the second should be equal to the number of them modulo
998244353
.
You should print only the second number modulo
998244353
.

Note
The first test case was explained in the statement.
In the second test case
p=[100,101,102,103,104,105,104,103,102,103,104,105,106,107,108]
.
In the third test case
p=[1,2,…,2000000000]
.
