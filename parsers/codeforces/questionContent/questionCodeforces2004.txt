In the
2022
year, Mike found two binary integers
a
and
b
of length
n
(both of them are written only by digits
0
and
1
) that can have leading zeroes. In order not to forget them, he wanted to construct integer
d
in the following way:
he creates an integer
c
as a result of bitwise summing of
a
and
b
without transferring carry, so
c
may have one or more
2
-s. For example, the result of bitwise summing of
0110
and
1101
is
1211
or the sum of
011000
and
011000
is
022000
;
after that Mike replaces equal consecutive digits in
c
by one digit, thus getting
d
. In the cases above after this operation,
1211
becomes
121
and
022000
becomes
020
(so,
d
won't have equal consecutive digits).
Unfortunately, Mike lost integer
a
before he could calculate
d
himself. Now, to cheer him up, you want to find any binary integer
a
of length
n
such that
d
will be maximum possible as integer.
Maximum possible as integer means that
102>21
,
012<101
,
021=21
and so on.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains the integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of
a
and
b
.
The second line of each test case contains binary integer
b
of length
n
. The integer
b
consists only of digits
0
and
1
.
It is guaranteed that the total sum of
n
over all
t
test cases doesn't exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case output one binary integer
a
of length
n
. Note, that
a
or
b
may have leading zeroes but must have the same length
n
.

Note
In the first test case,
b=0
and choosing
a=1
gives
d=1
as a result.
In the second test case,
b=011
so:
if you choose
a=000
,
c
will be equal to
011
, so
d=01
;
if you choose
a=111
,
c
will be equal to
122
, so
d=12
;
if you choose
a=010
, you'll get
d=021
.
If you select
a=110
, you'll get
d=121
.
We can show that answer
a=110
is optimal and
d=121
is maximum possible.
In the third test case,
b=110
. If you choose
a=100
, you'll get
d=210
and it's the maximum possible
d
.
In the fourth test case,
b=111000
. If you choose
a=101101
, you'll get
d=212101
and it's maximum possible
d
.
In the fifth test case,
b=001011
. If you choose
a=101110
, you'll get
d=102121
and it's maximum possible
d
.
