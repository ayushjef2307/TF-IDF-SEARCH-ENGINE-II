Note that the memory limit is unusual.
You are given an integer
n
and two sequences
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
.
Let's call a set of integers
S
such that
S⊆{1,2,3,…,n}
strange, if, for every element
i
of
S
, the following condition is met: for every
j∈[1,i−1]
, if
a
j
divides
a
i
, then
j
is also included in
S
. An empty set is always strange.
The cost of the set
S
is
∑
i∈S
b
i
. You have to calculate the maximum possible cost of a strange set.
Input
The first line contains one integer

Output
Print one integer — the maximum cost of a strange set.

Note
The strange set with the maximum cost in the first example is
{1,2,4,8,9}
.
The strange set with the maximum cost in the second example is empty.
