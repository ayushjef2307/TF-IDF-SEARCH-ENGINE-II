Polycarp found under the Christmas tree an array
a
of
n
elements and instructions for playing with it:
At first, choose index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) — starting position in the array. Put the chip at the index
i
(on the value
a
i
).
While
i≤n
, add
a
i
to your score and move the chip
a
i
positions to the right (i.e. replace
i
with
i+
a
i
).
If
i>n
, then Polycarp ends the game.
For example, if
n=5
and
a=[7,3,1,2,3]
, then the following game options are possible:
Polycarp chooses
i=1
. Game process:
i=1
⟶
+7
8
. The score of the game is:
a
1
=7
.
Polycarp chooses
i=2
. Game process:
i=2
⟶
+3
5
⟶
+3
8
. The score of the game is:
a
2
+
a
5
=6
.
Polycarp chooses
i=3
. Game process:
i=3
⟶
+1
4
⟶
+2
6
. The score of the game is:
a
3
+
a
4
=3
.
Polycarp chooses
i=4
. Game process:
i=4
⟶
+2
6
. The score of the game is:
a
4
=2
.
Polycarp chooses
i=5
. Game process:
i=5
⟶
+3
8
. The score of the game is:
a
5
=3
.
Help Polycarp to find out the maximum score he can get if he chooses the starting index in an optimal way.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array
a
.
The next line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — elements of the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output on a separate line one number — the maximum score that Polycarp can get by playing the game on the corresponding array according to the instruction from the statement. Note that Polycarp chooses any starting position from
1
to
n
in such a way as to maximize his result.

Note
The first test case is explained in the statement.
In the second test case, the maximum score can be achieved by choosing
i=1
.
In the third test case, the maximum score can be achieved by choosing
i=2
.
In the fourth test case, the maximum score can be achieved by choosing
i=1
.
