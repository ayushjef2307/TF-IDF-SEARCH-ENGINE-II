You have given an array
a
of length
n
and an integer
x
to a brand new robot. What the robot does is the following: it iterates over the elements of the array, let the current element be
q
. If
q
is divisible by
x
, the robot adds
x
copies of the integer
q
x
to the end of the array, and moves on to the next element. Note that the newly added elements could be processed by the robot later. Otherwise, if
q
is not divisible by
x
, the robot shuts down.
Please determine the sum of all values of the array at the end of the process.
Input
The first input line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
x
(
1≤n≤
10
5
,
2≤x≤
10
9
) — the length of the array and the value which is used by the robot.
The next line contains integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the initial values in the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of values
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case output one integer — the sum of all elements at the end of the process.

Note
In the first test case the array initially consists of a single element
[12]
, and
x=2
. After the robot processes the first element, the array becomes
[12,6,6]
. Then the robot processes the second element, and the array becomes
[12,6,6,3,3]
. After the robot processes the next element, the array becomes
[12,6,6,3,3,3,3]
, and then the robot shuts down, since it encounters an element that is not divisible by
x=2
. The sum of the elements in the resulting array is equal to
36
.
In the second test case the array initially contains integers
[4,6,8,2]
, and
x=2
. The resulting array in this case looks like
[4,6,8,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,1,1,1,1,1,1]
.
