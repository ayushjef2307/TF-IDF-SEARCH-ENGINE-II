A set of positive integers
S
is called beautiful if, for every two integers
x
and
y
from this set, either
x
divides
y
or
y
divides
x
(or both).
You are given two integers
l
and
r
. Consider all beautiful sets consisting of integers not less than
l
and not greater than
r
. You have to print two numbers:
the maximum possible size of a beautiful set where all elements are from
l
to
r
;
the number of beautiful sets consisting of integers from
l
to
r
with the maximum possible size.
Since the second number can be very large, print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤
10
6
).
Output
For each test case, print two integers — the maximum possible size of a beautiful set consisting of integers from
l
to
r
, and the number of such sets with maximum possible size. Since the second number can be very large, print it modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case, the maximum possible size of a beautiful set with integers from
3
