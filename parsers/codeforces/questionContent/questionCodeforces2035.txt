Suppose you have a sequence of
k
integers
A=[
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
k
]
where each
a
i
≥2
. A sequence of prime integers
P=[
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
k
]
is called suitable for the sequence
A
if
a
1
is divisible by
p
1
,
a
2
is divisible by
p
2
and so on.
A sequence of prime integers
P
is called friendly if there are no unique integers in this sequence.
A sequence
A
is called ideal, if each sequence
P
that is suitable for
A
is friendly as well (i. e. there is no sequence
P
that is suitable for
A
, but not friendly). For example, the sequence
[2,4,16]
is ideal, while the sequence
[2,4,6]
is not ideal (there exists a sequence
P=[2,2,3]
which is suitable for
A
, but not friendly).
You are given
n
different integers
x
1
,
x
2
, ...,
x
n
. You have to choose exactly
k
of them in such a way that they form an ideal sequence, or report that it is impossible. Note that no integer can be chosen more than once.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤1000
).
The second line contains
n
pairwise distinct integers
x
1
,
x
2
, ...,
x
n
(
2≤
x
i
≤
10
18
).
Output
If it is impossible to choose exactly
k
integers from
x
1
,
x
2
, ...,
x
n
in such a way that the chosen integers form an ideal sequence, print
0
.
Otherwise, print
k
pairwise distinct integers — the elements of the chosen ideal sequence. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
