inputstandard input
outputstandard output
You are given two strings
a
and
b
, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
A template
t
is string, consisting of lowercase Latin letters and asterisks (character '*'). A template is called asterisk-minor if the number of asterisks in it is less than or equal to the number of letters in it.
A string
s
is said to be matching a template
t
if you can replace each asterisk in
t
with a string of lowercase Latin letters (possibly, an empty string) so that it becomes equal to
s
.
Find an asterisk-minor template such that both
a
and
b
match it, or report that such a template doesn't exist. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains a string
a
(
1≤|a|≤50
, where
|a|
is the length of
a
), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
The second line contains a string
b
(
1≤|b|≤50
), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Output
For each testcase, output "NO", if there doesn't exist an asterisk-minor template that both
a
and
b
match. Otherwise, print "YES" in the first line and the template in the second line. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
A template should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and asterisks (character '*'). The number of asterisks should be less than or equal to the number of letters.

Note
In the first testcase, for a template "*b", you can replace the only asterisk with "aaa" to get "aaab" (which is equal to
a
) or with "zzz" to get "zzzb" (which is equal to
b
).
In the third testcase, a template "*o*" is not asterisk-minor, as it contains more asterisks than letters. There are no asterisk-minor templates that both
a
and
b
match.
In the fourth testcase, for a template "a*a*a*a", you can replace all asterisks with empty strings to get "aaaa" (which is equal to
a
) or two of them with "a" and two of them with an empty string to get "aaaaaa" (which is equal to
b
).
In the fifth testcase, there are no asterisks in a template "abcd", so only "abcd" can match it (which is coincidentally both
a
and
b
).
