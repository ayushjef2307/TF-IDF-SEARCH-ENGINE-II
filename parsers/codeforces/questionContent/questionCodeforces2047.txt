You are given a tree with
n
vertices. Each vertex
i
has a value
a
i
associated with it.
Let us root the tree at some vertex
v
. The vertex
v
is called a distinctive root if the following holds: in all paths that start at
v
and end at some other node, all the values encountered are distinct. Two different paths may have values in common but a single path must have all distinct values.
Find the number of distinctive roots in the tree.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The next line contains
n
space-separated integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
The following
n−1
lines each contain two space-separated integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u
,
v≤n
), denoting an edge from
u
to
v
.
It is guaranteed that the edges form a tree.
Output
Print a single integer — the number of distinctive roots in the tree.
