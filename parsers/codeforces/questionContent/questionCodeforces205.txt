The FB-string is formed as follows. Initially, it is empty. We go through all positive integers, starting from
1
, in ascending order, and do the following for each integer:
if the current integer is divisible by
3
, append F to the end of the FB-string;
if the current integer is divisible by
5
, append B to the end of the FB-string.
Note that if an integer is divisible by both
3
and
5
, we append F, and then B, not in the opposite order.
The first
10
characters of the FB-string are FBFFBFFBFB: the first F comes from the integer
3
, the next character (B) comes from
5
, the next F comes from the integer
6
, and so on. It's easy to see that this string is infinitely long. Let
f
i
be the
i
-th character of FB-string; so,
f
1
is F,
f
2
is B,
f
3
is F,
f
4
is F, and so on.
You are given a string
s
, consisting of characters F and/or B. You have to determine whether it is a substring (contiguous subsequence) of the FB-string. In other words, determine if it is possible to choose two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r
) so that the string
f
l
f
l+1
f
l+2
…
f
r
is exactly
s
.
For example:
FFB is a substring of the FB-string: if we pick
l=3
and
r=5
, the string
f
3
f
4
f
5
is exactly FFB;
BFFBFFBF is a substring of the FB-string: if we pick
l=2
and
r=9
, the string
f
2
f
3
f
4
…
f
9
is exactly BFFBFFBF;
BBB is not a substring of the FB-string.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2046
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains one integer
k
(
1≤k≤10
) — the number of characters in
s
. The second line contains
s
, which is a string of exactly
k
characters. Each character of
s
is either F or B.
Output
For each test case, print YES if
s
is a substring of the FB-string, or NO otherwise.
You may print each letter in any case (YES, yes, Yes will all be recognized as positive answer, NO, no and nO will all be recognized as negative answer).
