Ron is a happy owner of a permutation
a
of length
n
.
A permutation of length
n
is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Ron's permutation is subjected to
m
experiments of the following type: (
r
i
,
p
i
). This means that elements in range
[1,
r
i
]
(in other words, the prefix of length
r
i
) have to be sorted in ascending order with the probability of
p
i
. All experiments are performed in the same order in which they are specified in the input data.
As an example, let's take a look at a permutation
[4,2,1,5,3]
and an experiment (
3,0.6
). After such an experiment with the probability of
60%
the permutation will assume the form
[1,2,4,5,3]
and with a
40%
probability it will remain unchanged.
You have to determine the probability of the permutation becoming completely sorted in ascending order after
m
experiments.
Input
Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
).
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(1≤n,m≤
10
5
)
 — the length of the permutation and the number of experiments, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(1≤
a
i
≤n)
 — contents of the permutation.
The following
m
lines of each test case each contain an integer
r
i
and a real number
p
i
(1≤
r
i
≤n,0≤
p
i
≤1)
 — the length of the prefix and the probability of it being sorted. All probabilities are given with at most
6
decimal places.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
and the sum of
m
does not exceed
10
5
(
∑n,∑m≤
10
5
).
Output
For each test case, print a single number — the probability that after all experiments the permutation becomes sorted in ascending order. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
−6
.
Formally, let your answer be
a
, and the jury's answer be
b
. Your answer is accepted if and only if
|a−b|
max(1,|b|)
≤
10
−6
.

Note
Explanation of the first test case: It can be demonstrated that whether the final permutation is sorted or not depends solely on sorting being performed in the
(4,0.6)
experiment.
