Holidays are coming up really soon. Rick realized that it's time to think about buying a traditional spruce tree. But Rick doesn't want real trees to get hurt so he decided to find some in an
n×m
matrix consisting of "*" and ".".
To find every spruce first let's define what a spruce in the matrix is. A set of matrix cells is called a spruce of height
k
with origin at point
(x,y)
if:
All cells in the set contain an "*".
For each
1≤i≤k
all cells with the row number
x+i−1
and columns in range
[y−i+1,y+i−1]
must be a part of the set. All other cells cannot belong to the set.
Examples of correct and incorrect spruce trees:
Now Rick wants to know how many spruces his
n×m
matrix contains. Help Rick solve this problem.
Input
Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤10
).
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤500
) — matrix size.
Next
n
lines of each test case contain
m
characters
c
i,j
 — matrix contents. It is guaranteed that
c
i,j
is either a "." or an "*".
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n⋅m
over all test cases does not exceed
500
2
(
∑n⋅m≤
500
2
).
Output
For each test case, print single integer — the total number of spruces in the matrix.

Note
In the first test case the first spruce of height
2
has its origin at point
(1,2)
, the second spruce of height
1
has its origin at point
(1,2)
, the third spruce of height
1
has its origin at point
(2,1)
, the fourth spruce of height
1
has its origin at point
(2,2)
, the fifth spruce of height
1
has its origin at point
(2,3)
.
In the second test case the first spruce of height
1
has its origin at point
(1,2)
, the second spruce of height
1
has its origin at point
(2,1)
, the third spruce of height
1
has its origin at point
(2,2)
