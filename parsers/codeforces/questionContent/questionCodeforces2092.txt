You are given four different integer points
p
1
,
p
2
,
p
3
and
p
4
on
XY
grid.
In one step you can choose one of the points
p
i
and move it in one of four directions by one. In other words, if you have chosen point
p
i
=(x,y)
you can move it to
(x,y+1)
,
(x,y−1)
,
(x+1,y)
or
(x−1,y)
.
Your goal to move points in such a way that they will form a square with sides parallel to
OX
and
OY
axes (a square with side
0
is allowed).
What is the minimum number of steps you need to make such a square?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of four lines. Each line contains two integers
x
and
y
(
0≤x,y≤
10
9
) — coordinates of one of the points
p
i
=(x,y)
.
All points are different in one test case.
Output
For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum number of steps to make a square.

Note
In the first test case, one of the optimal solutions is shown below:
Each point was moved two times, so the answer
2+2+2+2=8
.
In the second test case, one of the optimal solutions is shown below:
The answer is
3+1+0+3=7
.
In the third test case, one of the optimal solutions is shown below:
The answer is
1+1+2+1=5
.
