You are given a sequence
a
consisting of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
, and an integer
x
. Your task is to make the sequence
a
sorted (it is considered sorted if the condition
a
1
≤
a
2
≤
a
3
≤⋯≤
a
n
holds).
To make the sequence sorted, you may perform the following operation any number of times you want (possibly zero): choose an integer
i
such that
1≤i≤n
and
a
i
>x
, and swap the values of
a
i
and
x
.
For example, if
a=[0,2,3,5,4]
,
x=1
, the following sequence of operations is possible:
choose
i=2
(it is possible since
a
2
>x
), then
a=[0,1,3,5,4]
,
x=2
;
choose
i=3
(it is possible since
a
3
>x
), then
a=[0,1,2,5,4]
,
x=3
;
choose
i=4
(it is possible since
a
4
>x
), then
a=[0,1,2,3,4]
,
x=5
.
Calculate the minimum number of operations you have to perform so that
a
becomes sorted, or report that it is impossible.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤500
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers
n
and
x
(
1≤n≤500
,
0≤x≤500
) — the number of elements in the sequence and the initial value of
x
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤500
).
The sum of values of
n
over all test cases in the input does not exceed
500
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of operations you have to perform to make
a
sorted, or
−1
, if it is impossible.
