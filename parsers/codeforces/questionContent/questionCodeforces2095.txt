You are standing on the
OX
-axis at point
0
and you want to move to an integer point
x>0
.
You can make several jumps. Suppose you're currently at point
y
(
y
may be negative) and jump for the
k
-th time. You can:
either jump to the point
y+k
or jump to the point
y−1
.
What is the minimum number of jumps you need to reach the point
x
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains the single integer
x
(
1≤x≤
10
6
) — the destination point.
Output
For each test case, print the single integer — the minimum number of jumps to reach
x
. It can be proved that we can reach any integer point
x
.

Note
In the first test case
x=1
, so you need only one jump: the
1
-st jump from
0
to
0+1=1
.
In the second test case
x=2
. You need at least three jumps:
the
1
-st jump from
0
to
0+1=1
;
the
2
-nd jump from
1
to
1+2=3
;
the
3
-rd jump from
3
to
3−1=2
;
Two jumps are not enough because these are the only possible variants:
the
1
-st jump as
−1
and the
2
-nd one as
−1
 — you'll reach
0−1−1=−2
;
the
1
-st jump as
−1
and the
2
-nd one as
+2
 — you'll reach
0−1+2=1
;
the
1
-st jump as
+1
and the
2
-nd one as
−1
 — you'll reach
0+1−1=0
;
the
1
-st jump as
+1
and the
2
-nd one as
+2
 — you'll reach
0+1+2=3
;
In the third test case, you need two jumps: the
1
-st one as
+1
and the
2
-nd one as
+2
, so
0+1+2=3
.
In the fourth test case, you need three jumps: the
1
-st one as
−1
, the
2
-nd one as
+2
and the
3
-rd one as
+3
, so
0−1+2+3=4
.
