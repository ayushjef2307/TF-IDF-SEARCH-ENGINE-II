Sadly, the problem setter couldn't think of an interesting story, thus he just asks you to solve the following problem.
Given an array
a
consisting of
n
positive integers, count the number of non-empty subsequences for which the bitwise
AND
of the elements in the subsequence has exactly
k
set bits in its binary representation. The answer may be large, so output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Recall that the subsequence of an array
a
is a sequence that can be obtained from
a
by removing some (possibly, zero) elements. For example,
[1,2,3]
,
[3]
,
[1,3]
are subsequences of
[1,2,3]
, but
[3,2]
and
[4,5,6]
are not.
Note that
AND
represents the bitwise AND operation.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case consists of two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
0≤k≤6
) — the length of the array and the number of set bits that the bitwise
AND
the counted subsequences should have in their binary representation.
The second line of each test case consists of
n
integers
a
i
(
0≤
a
i
≤63
) — the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of subsequences that have exactly
k
set bits in their bitwise
AND
value's binary representation. The answer may be large, so output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
