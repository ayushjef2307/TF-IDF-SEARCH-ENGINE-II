The only difference between the easy and hard versions is the constraints on the number of queries.
This is an interactive problem.
Ridbit has a hidden array
a
of
n
integers which he wants Ashish to guess. Note that
n
is a power of two. Ashish is allowed to ask three different types of queries. They are of the form
AND
i
j
: ask for the bitwise AND of elements
a
i
and
a
j
(1≤i,j≤n
,
i≠j)
OR
i
j
: ask for the bitwise OR of elements
a
i
and
a
j
(1≤i,j≤n
,
i≠j)
XOR
i
j
: ask for the bitwise XOR of elements
a
i
and
a
j
(1≤i,j≤n
,
i≠j)
Can you help Ashish guess the elements of the array?
In this version, each element takes a value in the range
[0,n−1]
(inclusive) and Ashish can ask no more than
n+2
queries.
Input
The first line of input contains one integer
n
(4≤n≤
2
16
)
 — the length of the array. It is guaranteed that
n
is a power of two.
Interaction
To ask a query print a single line containing one of the following (without quotes)
"AND i j"
"OR i j"
"XOR i j"
where
i
and
j
(1≤i,j≤n
,
i≠j)
denote the indices being queried.
For each query, you will receive an integer
x
whose value depends on the type of query. If the indices queried are invalid or you exceed the number of queries however, you will get
x=−1
. In this case, you should terminate the program immediately.
When you have guessed the elements of the array, print a single line "! " (without quotes), followed by
n
space-separated integers  — the elements of the array.
Guessing the array does not count towards the number of queries asked.
The interactor is not adaptive. The array
a
does not change with queries.
After printing a query do not forget to output the end of the line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:
fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
flush(output) in Pascal;
stdout.flush() in Python;
see the documentation for other languages.
Hacks
To hack the solution, use the following test format:
On the first line print a single integer
n
(4≤n≤
2
16
)
 — the length of the array. It must be a power of 2. The next line should contain
n
space-separated integers in the range
[0,n−1]
 — the array
a
.

Note
The array

in the example is
[0,0,2,3]
