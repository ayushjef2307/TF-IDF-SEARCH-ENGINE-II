Utkarsh is forced to play yet another one of Ashish's games. The game progresses turn by turn and as usual, Ashish moves first.
Consider the 2D plane. There is a token which is initially at
(0,0)
. In one move a player must increase either the
x
coordinate or the
y
coordinate of the token by exactly
k
. In doing so, the player must ensure that the token stays within a (Euclidean) distance
d
from
(0,0)
.
In other words, if after a move the coordinates of the token are
(p,q)
, then
p
2
+
q
2
≤
d
2
must hold.
The game ends when a player is unable to make a move. It can be shown that the game will end in a finite number of moves. If both players play optimally, determine who will win.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two space separated integers
d
(
1≤d≤
10
5
) and
k
(
1≤k≤d
).
Output
For each test case, if Ashish wins the game, print "Ashish", otherwise print "Utkarsh" (without the quotes).
