Ridbit starts with an integer
n
.
In one move, he can perform one of the following operations:
divide
n
by one of its proper divisors, or
subtract
1
from
n
if
n
is greater than
1
.
A proper divisor is a divisor of a number, excluding itself. For example,
1
,
2
,
4
,
5
, and
10
are proper divisors of
20
, but
20
itself is not.
What is the minimum number of moves Ridbit is required to make to reduce
n
to
1
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, output the minimum number of moves required to reduce
n
to
1
.
