On the competitive programming platform CodeCook, every person has a rating graph described by an array of integers
a
of length
n
. You are now updating the infrastructure, so you've created a program to compress these graphs.
The program works as follows. Given an integer parameter
k
, the program takes the minimum of each contiguous subarray of length
k
in
a
.
More formally, for an array
a
of length
n
and an integer
k
, define the
k
-compression array of
a
as an array
b
of length
n−k+1
, such that
b
j
=
min
j≤i≤j+k−1
a
i
b
min
For example, the
3
-compression array of
[1,3,4,5,2]
is
[min{1,3,4},min{3,4,5},min{4,5,2}]=[1,3,2].
A permutation of length
m
is an array consisting of
m
distinct integers from
1
to
m
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
m=3
but there is
4
in the array).
A
k
-compression array will make CodeCook users happy if it will be a permutation. Given an array
a
, determine for all
1≤k≤n
if CodeCook users will be happy after a
k
-compression of this array or not.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of the description of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤3⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array.
The second line of the description of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed, that the sum of
n
for all test cases does not exceed
3⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a binary string of length
n
.
The
k
-th character of the string should be
1
if CodeCook users will be happy after a
k
-compression of the array
a
, and
0
otherwise.

Note
In the first test case,
a=[1,5,3,4,2]
.
The
1
-compression of
a
is
[1,5,3,4,2]
and it is a permutation.
The
2
-compression of
a
is
[1,3,3,2]
and it is not a permutation, since
3
appears twice.
The
3
-compression of
a
is
[1,3,2]
and it is a permutation.
The
4
-compression of
a
is
[1,2]
and it is a permutation.
The
5
-compression of
a
is
[1]
and it is a permutation.
