The prime factorization of a positive integer
m
is the unique way to write it as
m=
p
e
1
1
⋅
p
e
2

⋅…⋅
p

k
k
, where
p
1
,
p

,…,
p

are prime numbers,
p

<
p

<…<
p
k
and
e
1
,
e

,…,
e
k
are positive integers.
For each positive integer
m
,
f(m)
is defined as the multiset of all numbers in its prime factorization, that is
f(m)={
p
1
,
e

,
p

,
e

,…,
p
k
,

}
.
For example,
f(24)={2,3,3,1}
,
f(5)={1,5}
and
f(1)={}
.
You are given a list consisting of
2n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
2n
. Count how many positive integers
m
satisfy that
f(m)={
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
2n
}
. Since this value may be large, print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2022
).
The second line contains
2n
integers
a

a
2n
(
1≤

i
≤
10

Output
Print one integer, the number of positive integers
m
satisfying
f(m)={
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
2n
}
modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first sample, the two values of
m
such that
f(m)={1,2,3,3}
are
m=24
and
m=54
. Their prime factorizations are
24=
2

⋅

and
54=
2

⋅

.
In the second sample, the five values of
m
such that
f(m)={2,2,3,5}
are
200,225,288,500
and
972
.
In the third sample, there is no value of
m
such that
f(m)={1,4}
. Neither
1
4
nor
4
1
are prime factorizations because
1
and
4
are not primes.
