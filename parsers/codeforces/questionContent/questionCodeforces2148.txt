Oleg's favorite subjects are History and Math, and his favorite branch of mathematics is division.
To improve his division skills, Oleg came up with
t
pairs of integers
p
i
and
q
i
and for each pair decided to find the greatest integer
x
i
, such that:
p
i
is divisible by
x
i
;
x
i
is not divisible by
q
i
.
Oleg is really good at division and managed to find all the answers quickly, how about you?
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤50
) — the number of pairs.
Each of the following
t
lines contains two integers
p
i
and
q
i
(
1≤
p
i
≤
10
18
;
2≤
q
i
≤
10
9
) — the
i
-th pair of integers.
Output
Print
t
integers: the
i
-th integer is the largest
x
i
such that
p
i
is divisible by
x
i
, but
x
i
is not divisible by
q
i
.
One can show that there is always at least one value of
x
i
satisfying the divisibility conditions for the given constraints.

Note
For the first pair, where
p
1
=10
and
q
1
=4
, the answer is
x
1
=10
, since it is the greatest divisor of
10
and
10
is not divisible by
4
.
For the second pair, where
p
2
=12
and
q
2
=6
, note that
12
is not a valid
x
2
, since
12
is divisible by
q
2
=6
;
6
is not valid
x
2
as well:
6
is also divisible by
q
2
=6
.
The next available divisor of
p
2
=12
is
4
, which is the answer, since
4
is not divisible by
6
.
