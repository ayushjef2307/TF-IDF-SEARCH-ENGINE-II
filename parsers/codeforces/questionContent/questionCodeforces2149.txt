A permutation is a sequence of integers from
1
to
n
of length
n
containing each number exactly once. For example,
[1]
,
[4,3,5,1,2]
,
[3,2,1]
 — are permutations, and
[1,1]
,
[4,3,1]
,
[2,3,4]
 — no.
Permutation
a
is lexicographically smaller than permutation
b
(they have the same length
n
), if in the first index
i
in which they differ,
a[i]<b[i]
. For example, the permutation
[1,3,2,4]
is lexicographically smaller than the permutation
[1,3,4,2]
, because the first two elements are equal, and the third element in the first permutation is smaller than in the second.
The next permutation for a permutation
a
of length
n
 — is the lexicographically smallest permutation
b
of length
n
that lexicographically larger than
a
. For example:
for permutation
[2,1,4,3]
the next permutation is
[2,3,1,4]
;
for permutation
[1,2,3]
the next permutation is
[1,3,2]
;
for permutation
[2,1]
next permutation does not exist.
You are given the number
n
 — the length of the initial permutation. The initial permutation has the form
a=[1,2,…,n]
. In other words,
a[i]=i
(
1≤i≤n
).
You need to process
q
queries of two types:
1
l
r
: query for the sum of all elements on the segment
[l,r]
. More formally, you need to find
a[l]+a[l+1]+…+a[r]
.
2
x
:
x
times replace the current permutation with the next permutation. For example, if
x=2
and the current permutation has the form
[1,3,4,2]
, then we should perform such a chain of replacements
[1,3,4,2]→[1,4,2,3]→[1,4,3,2]
.
For each query of the
1
-st type output the required sum.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) and
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅
10
5
), where
n
 — the length of the initial permutation, and
q
 — the number of queries.
The next
q
lines contain a single query of the
1
-st or
2
-nd type. The
1
-st type query consists of three integers
1
,
l
and
r
(1≤l≤r≤n)
, the
2
-nd type query consists of two integers
2
and
x
(1≤x≤
10
5
)
.
It is guaranteed that all requests of the
2
-nd type are possible to process.
Output
For each query of the
1
-st type, output on a separate line one integer — the required sum.

Note
Initially, the permutation has the form
[1,2,3,4]
. Queries processing is as follows:
2+3+4=9
;
[1,2,3,4]→[1,2,4,3]→[1,3,2,4]→[1,3,4,2]
;
1+3=4
;
4+2=6
