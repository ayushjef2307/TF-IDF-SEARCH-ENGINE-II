A median of an array of integers of length
n
is the number standing on the
⌈
n
2
⌉
(rounding up) position in the non-decreasing ordering of its elements. Positions are numbered starting with
1
. For example, a median of the array
[2,6,4,1,3,5]
is equal to
3
. There exist some other definitions of the median, but in this problem, we will use the described one.
Given two integers
n
and
k
and non-decreasing array of
nk
integers. Divide all numbers into
k
arrays of size
n
, such that each number belongs to exactly one array.
You want the sum of medians of all
k
arrays to be the maximum possible. Find this maximum possible sum.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The next
2t
lines contain descriptions of test cases.
The first line of the description of each test case contains two integers
n
,
k
(
1≤n,k≤1000
).
The second line of the description of each test case contains
nk
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
nk
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — given array. It is guaranteed that the array is non-decreasing:
a
1
≤
a
2
≤…≤
a
nk
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
nk
for all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print a single integer — the maximum possible sum of medians of all
k
arrays.
