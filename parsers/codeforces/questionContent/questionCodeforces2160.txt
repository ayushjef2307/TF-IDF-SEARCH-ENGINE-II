You are given four integers
n
,
c
0
,
c
1
and
h
and a binary string
s
of length
n
.
A binary string is a string consisting of characters
0
and
1
.
You can change any character of the string
s
(the string should be still binary after the change). You should pay
h
coins for each change.
After some changes (possibly zero) you want to buy the string. To buy the string you should buy all its characters. To buy the character
0
you should pay
c
0
coins, to buy the character
1
you should pay
c
1
coins.
Find the minimum number of coins needed to buy the string.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤10
) — the number of test cases. Next
2t
lines contain descriptions of test cases.
The first line of the description of each test case contains four integers
n
,
c
0
,
c
1
,
h
(
1≤n,
c
0
,
c
1
,h≤1000
).
The second line of the description of each test case contains the binary string
s
of length
n
.
Output
For each test case print a single integer — the minimum number of coins needed to buy the string.

Note
In the first test case, you can buy all characters and pay
3
coins, because both characters
0
and
1
costs
1
coin.
In the second test case, you can firstly change
2
-nd and
4
-th symbols of the string from
1
to
0
and pay
2
coins for that. Your string will be
00000
. After that, you can buy the string and pay
5⋅10=50
coins for that. The total number of coins paid will be
2+50=52
.
