You are given an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of integers. This array is non-increasing.
Let's consider a line with
n
shops. The shops are numbered with integers from
1
to
n
from left to right. The cost of a meal in the
i
-th shop is equal to
a
i
.
You should process
q
queries of two types:
1 x y: for each shop
1≤i≤x
set
a
i
=max(
a
i
,y)
.
2 x y: let's consider a hungry man with
y
money. He visits the shops from
x
-th shop to
n
-th and if he can buy a meal in the current shop he buys one item of it. Find how many meals he will purchase. The man can buy a meal in the shop
i
if he has at least
a
i
money, and after it his money decreases by
a
i
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
,
q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
)
 — the costs of the meals. It is guaranteed, that
a
1
≥
a
2
≥…≥
a
n
.
Each of the next
q
lines contains three integers
t
,
x
,
y
(
1≤t≤2
,
1≤x≤n
,
1≤y≤
10
9
), each describing the next query.
It is guaranteed that there exists at least one query of type
2
.
Output
For each query of type
2
output the answer on the new line.

Note
In the first query a hungry man will buy meals in all shops from
3
to
10
.
In the second query a hungry man will buy meals in shops
4
,
9
, and
10
.
After the third query the array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of costs won't change and will be
{10,10,10,6,6,5,5,5,3,1}
.
In the fourth query a hungry man will buy meals in shops
2
,
3
,
4
,
5
,
9
, and
10
.
After the fifth query the array
a
of costs will be
{10,10,10,7,6,5,5,5,3,1}
.
In the sixth query a hungry man will buy meals in shops
2
and
4
.
