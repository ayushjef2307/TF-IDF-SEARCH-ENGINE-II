You are given an undirected graph with
n
vertices and
m
edges. Also, you are given an integer
k
.
Find either a clique of size
k
or a non-empty subset of vertices such that each vertex of this subset has at least
k
neighbors in the subset. If there are no such cliques and subsets report about it.
A subset of vertices is called a clique of size
k
if its size is
k
and there exists an edge between every two vertices from the subset. A vertex is called a neighbor of the other vertex if there exists an edge between them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of test cases.
The first line of the description of each test case contains three integers
n
,
m
,
k
(
1≤n,m,k≤
10
5
,
k≤n
).
Each of the next
m
lines contains two integers
u,v
(1≤u,v≤n,u≠v)
, denoting an edge between vertices
u
and
v
.
It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
for all test cases and the sum of
m
for all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case:
If you found a subset of vertices such that each vertex of this subset has at least
k
neighbors in the subset in the first line output
1
and the size of the subset. On the second line output the vertices of the subset in any order.
If you found a clique of size
k
then in the first line output
2
and in the second line output the vertices of the clique in any order.
If there are no required subsets and cliques print
−1
.
If there exists multiple possible answers you can print any of them.

Note
In the first test case: the subset
{1,2,3,4}
is a clique of size
4
.
In the second test case: degree of each vertex in the original graph is at least
3
. So the set of all vertices is a correct answer.
In the third test case: there are no cliques of size
4
or required subsets, so the answer is
−1
.
