Ksenia has an array
a
consisting of
n
positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
.
In one operation she can do the following:
choose three distinct indices
i
,
j
,
k
, and then
change all of
a
i
,
a
j
,
a
k
to
a
i
⊕
a
j
⊕
a
k
simultaneously, where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
She wants to make all
a
i
equal in at most
n
operations, or to determine that it is impossible to do so. She wouldn't ask for your help, but please, help her!
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers,
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — elements of
a
.
Output
Print YES or NO in the first line depending on whether it is possible to make all elements equal in at most
n
operations.
If it is possible, print an integer
m
(
0≤m≤n
), which denotes the number of operations you do.
In each of the next
m
lines, print three distinct integers
i,j,k
, representing one operation.
If there are many such operation sequences possible, print any. Note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations.
