You're given an array
b
of length
n
. Let's define another array
a
, also of length
n
, for which
a
i
=
2
b
i
(
1≤i≤n
).
Valerii says that every two non-intersecting subarrays of
a
have different sums of elements. You want to determine if he is wrong. More formally, you need to determine if there exist four integers
l
1
,
r
1
,
l
2
,
r
2
that satisfy the following conditions:
1≤
l
1
≤
r

<
l
2
≤
r

≤n
;

.
If such four integers exist, you will prove Valerii wrong. Do they exist?
An array
c
is a subarray of an array
d
if
c
can be obtained from
d
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of every test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤1000
).
The second line of every test case contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
0≤
b
i
≤
10
9
).
Output
For every test case, if there exist two non-intersecting subarrays in
a
that have the same sum, output YES on a separate line. Otherwise, output NO on a separate line.
Also, note that each letter can be in any case.

Note
In the first case,
a=[16,8,1,2,4,1]
. Choosing
l
1
=1
,
r
1
=1
,
l
2
=2
and
r
2
=6
works because
16=(8+1+2+4+1)
.
In the second case, you can verify that there is no way to select to such subarrays.
