One day,
n
people (
n
is an even number) met on a plaza and made two round dances, each round dance consists of exactly
n
2
people. Your task is to find the number of ways
n
people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly
n
2
people. Each person should belong to exactly one of these two round dances.
Round dance is a dance circle consisting of
1
or more people. Two round dances are indistinguishable (equal) if one can be transformed to another by choosing the first participant. For example, round dances
[1,3,4,2]
,
[4,2,1,3]
and
[2,1,3,4]
are indistinguishable.
For example, if
n=2
then the number of ways is
1
: one round dance consists of the first person and the second one of the second person.
For example, if
n=4
then the number of ways is
3
. Possible options:
one round dance —
[1,2]
, another —
[3,4]
;
one round dance —
[2,4]
, another —
[3,1]
;
one round dance —
[4,1]
, another —
[3,2]
.
Your task is to find the number of ways
n
people can make two round dances if each round dance consists of exactly
n
2
people.
