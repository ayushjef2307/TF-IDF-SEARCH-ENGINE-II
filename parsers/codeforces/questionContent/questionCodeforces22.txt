In a carnival game, there is a huge pyramid of cans with
2023
rows, numbered in a regular pattern as shown.
If can
9
2
is hit initially, then all cans colored red in the picture above would fall.
You throw a ball at the pyramid, and it hits a single can with number
n
2
. This causes all cans that are stacked on top of this can to fall (that is, can
n
2
falls, then the cans directly above
n
2
fall, then the cans directly above those cans, and so on). For example, the picture above shows the cans that would fall if can
9
2
is hit.
What is the sum of the numbers on all cans that fall? Recall that
n
2
=n×n
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
6
) — it means that the can you hit has label
n
2
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the sum of the numbers on all cans that fall.
Please note, that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++). For all valid inputs, the answer will always fit into 64-bit integer type.

In the second test case, only the can labeled
1
2
falls, so the answer is
1

=1
.
In the third test case, the cans labeled
1

and
2

fall, so the answer is
1

=1+4=5

In the fourth test case, the cans labeled
