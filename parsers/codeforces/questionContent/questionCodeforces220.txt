In winter, the inhabitants of the Moscow Zoo are very bored, in particular, it concerns gorillas. You decided to entertain them and brought a permutation
p
of length
n
to the zoo.
A permutation of length
n
is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in any order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
occurs twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
, but
4
is present in the array).
The gorillas had their own permutation
q
of length
n
. They suggested that you count the number of pairs of integers
l,r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) such that
MEX([
p
l
,
p
l+1
,…,
p
r
])=MEX([
q
l
,
q
l+1
,…,
q
r
])
.
The
MEX
of the sequence is the minimum integer positive number missing from this sequence. For example,
MEX([1,3])=2
,
MEX([5])=1
,
MEX([3,1,2,6])=4
.
You do not want to risk your health, so you will not dare to refuse the gorillas.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the permutations length.
The second line contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — the elements of the permutation
p
.
The third line contains
n
integers
q
1
,
q
2
,…,
q
n
(
1≤
q
i
≤n
) — the elements of the permutation
q
.
Output
Print a single integer — the number of suitable pairs
l
and
r
.

Note
In the first example, two segments are correct –
[1,3]
with
MEX
equal to
4
in both arrays and
[3,3]
with
MEX
equal to
1
in both of arrays.
In the second example, for example, the segment
[1,4]
is correct, and the segment
[6,7]
isn't correct, because
MEX(5,4)≠MEX(1,4)
.
