Numbers
1,2,3,…n
(each integer from
1
to
n
once) are written on a board. In one operation you can erase any two numbers
a
and
b
from the board and write one integer
a+b
2
rounded up instead.
You should perform the given operation
n−1
times and make the resulting number that will be left on the board as small as possible.
For example, if
n=4
, the following course of action is optimal:
choose
a=4
and
b=2
, so the new number is
3
, and the whiteboard contains
[1,3,3]
;
choose
a=3
and
b=3
, so the new number is
3
, and the whiteboard contains
[1,3]
;
choose
a=1
and
b=3
, so the new number is
2
, and the whiteboard contains
[2]
.
It's easy to see that after
n−1
operations, there will be left only one number. Your goal is to minimize it.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of integers written on the board initially.
It's guaranteed that the total sum of
n
over test cases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, in the first line, print the minimum possible number left on the board after
n−1
operations. Each of the next
n−1
lines should contain two integers — numbers
a
and
b
chosen and erased in each operation.
