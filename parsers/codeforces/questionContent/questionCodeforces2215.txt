There are some rabbits in Singapore Zoo. To feed them, Zookeeper bought
n
carrots with lengths
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
,…,
a
n
. However, rabbits are very fertile and multiply very quickly. Zookeeper now has
k
rabbits and does not have enough carrots to feed all of them. To solve this problem, Zookeeper decided to cut the carrots into
k
pieces. For some reason, all resulting carrot lengths must be positive integers.
Big carrots are very difficult for rabbits to handle and eat, so the time needed to eat a carrot of size
x
is
x
2
.
Help Zookeeper split his carrots while minimizing the sum of time taken for rabbits to eat the carrots.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(1≤n≤k≤
10
5
)
: the initial number of carrots and the number of rabbits.
The next line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(1≤
a
i
≤
10
6
)
: lengths of carrots.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
a
i
is at least
k
.
Output
Output one integer: the minimum sum of time taken for rabbits to eat carrots.
