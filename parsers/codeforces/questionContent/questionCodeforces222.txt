For his birthday recently Fedya was given an array
a
of
n
integers arranged in a circle, For each pair of neighboring numbers (
a
1
and
a
2
,
a
2
and
a
3
,
…
,
a
n−1
and
a
n
,
a
n
and
a
1
) the absolute difference between them is equal to
1
.
Let's call a local maximum an element, which is greater than both of its neighboring elements. Also call a local minimum an element, which is less than both of its neighboring elements. Note, that elements
a
1
and
a
n
are neighboring elements.
Unfortunately, Fedya lost an array, but he remembered in it the sum of local maximums
x
and the sum of local minimums
y
.
Given
x
and
y
, help Fedya find any matching array of minimum length.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤1000
). Description of the test cases follows.
Each line of each test case contain two integers
x
and
y
(
−
10
9
≤y<x≤
10
9
) — the sum of local maximums and the sum of local minimums, respectively.
Output
For each test case, in the first line print one integer
n
— the minimum length of matching arrays.
In the second line print
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−
10
9
⩽
a
i
⩽
10
9
) — the array elements such that the the absolute difference between each pair of neighboring is equal to
1
.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.

Note
In the first test case, the local maximums are the numbers at
3,7
and
10
positions, and the local minimums are the numbers at
1,6
and
8
positions.
