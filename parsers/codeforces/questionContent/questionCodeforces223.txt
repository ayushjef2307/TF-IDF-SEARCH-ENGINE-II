The famous store "Second Food" sells groceries only two days a month. And the prices in each of days differ. You wanted to buy
n
kilos of potatoes for a month. You know that on the first day of the month
1
kilo of potatoes costs
a
coins, and on the second day
b
coins. In "Second Food" you can buy any integer kilograms of potatoes.
Fortunately, "Second Food" has announced a promotion for potatoes, which is valid only on the first day of the month — for each
m
kilos of potatoes you buy, you get
1
kilo as a gift! In other words, you can get
m+1
kilograms by paying for
m
kilograms.
Find the minimum number of coins that you have to spend to buy at least
n
kilos of potatoes.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤10000
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(1≤a,b≤
10
9
)
— the prices of
1
kilo of potatoes on the first and second days, respectively.
The second line contains two integers
n
and
m
(1≤n,m≤
10
9
)
— the required amount of potatoes to buy and the amount of potatoes to use the promotion.
Output
For each test case print one integer — the minimum number of coins that you have to pay to buy at least
n
kilos of potatoes.

Note
In the first test case, on the first day you buy
1
kilo and get
1
more for a promotion. On the second day, you can buy
1
kilo of potatoes. Thus, you will spend
5+4=9
coins in total.
In the second test case, on the first day you buy
2
kilo and get another
1
more for a promotion. This way you will spend
2⋅5=10
coins.
