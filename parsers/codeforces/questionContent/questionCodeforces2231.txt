Initially, you have the array
a
consisting of one element
1
(
a=[1]
).
In one move, you can do one of the following things:
Increase some (single) element of
a
by
1
(choose some
i
from
1
to the current length of
a
and increase
a
i
by one);
Append the copy of some (single) element of
a
to the end of the array (choose some
i
from
1
to the current length of
a
and append
a
i
to the end of the array).
For example, consider the sequence of five moves:
You take the first element
a
1
, append its copy to the end of the array and get
a=[1,1]
.
You take the first element
a
1
, increase it by
1
and get
a=[2,1]
.
You take the second element
a
2
, append its copy to the end of the array and get
a=[2,1,1]
.
You take the first element
a
1
, append its copy to the end of the array and get
a=[2,1,1,2]
.
You take the fourth element
a
4
, increase it by
1
and get
a=[2,1,1,3]
.
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least
n
.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
9
) — the lower bound on the sum of the array.
Output
For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves required to obtain the array with the sum at least
n
.
