Mr. Chanek just won the national chess tournament and got a huge chessboard of size
N×M
. Bored with playing conventional chess, Mr. Chanek now defines a function
F(X,Y)
, which denotes the minimum number of moves to move a knight from square
(1,1)
to square
(X,Y)
. It turns out finding
F(X,Y)
is too simple, so Mr. Chanek defines:
G(X,Y)=
∑
N
i=X
∑
M
j=Y
F(i,j)
Given X and Y, you are tasked to find
G(X,Y)
.
A knight can move from square
(a,b)
to square
(
a
′
,
b
′
)
if and only if
|a−
a
′
|>0
,
|b−
b
′
|>0
, and
|a−
a
′
|+|b−
b
′
|=3
. Of course, the knight cannot leave the chessboard.
Input
The first line contains an integer
T
(1≤T≤100)
, the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a line with four integers
X

.
Output
For each test case, print a line with the value of
G(X,Y)
modulo
