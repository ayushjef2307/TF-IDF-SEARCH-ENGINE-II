In number world, two different numbers are friends if they have a lot in common, but also each one has unique perks.
More precisely, two different numbers
a
and
b
are friends if
gcd(a,b)
,
a
gcd(a,b)
,
b
gcd(a,b)
can form sides of a triangle.
Three numbers
a
,
b
and
c
can form sides of a triangle if
a+b>c
,
b+c>a
and
c+a>b
.
In a group of numbers, a number is lonely if it doesn't have any friends in that group.
Given a group of numbers containing all numbers from
1,2,3,...,n
, how many numbers in that group are lonely?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤
10
6
)
- number of test cases.
On next line there are
t
numbers,
n
i
(1≤
n
i
≤
10
6
)
- meaning that in case
i
you should solve for numbers
1,2,3,...,
n
i
.
Output
For each test case, print the answer on separate lines: number of lonely numbers in group
1,2,3,...,
n
i
.

Note
For first test case,
1
is the only number and therefore lonely.
For second test case where
n=5
, numbers
1
,
3
and
5
are lonely.
For third test case where
n=10
, numbers
1
,
5
and
7
are lonely.
