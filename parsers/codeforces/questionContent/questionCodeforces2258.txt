Yura owns a quite ordinary and boring array
a
of length
n
. You think there is nothing more boring than that, but Vladik doesn't agree!
In order to make Yura's array even more boring, Vladik makes
q
boring queries. Each query consists of two integers
x
and
y
. Before answering a query, the bounds
l
and
r
for this query are calculated:
l=(last+x)modn+1
,
r=(last+y)modn+1
, where
last
is the answer on the previous query (zero initially), and
mod
is the remainder operation. Whenever
l>r
, they are swapped.
After Vladik computes
l
and
r
for a query, he is to compute the least common multiple (LCM) on the segment
[l;r]
of the initial array
a
modulo
10
9
+7
. LCM of a multiset of integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by all the elements of the multiset. The obtained LCM is the answer for this query.
Help Vladik and compute the answer for each query!
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the array.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤2⋅
10
5
) — the elements of the array.
The third line contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤
10
5
) — the number of queries.
The next
q
lines contain two integers
x
and
y
each (
1≤x,y≤n
) — the description of the corresponding query.
Output
Print
q
integers — the answers for the queries.

Note
Consider the example:
boundaries for first query are
(0+1)mod3+1=2
and
(0+3)mod3+1=1
. LCM for segment
[1,2]
is equal to
6
;
boundaries for second query are
(6+3)mod3+1=1
and
(6+3)mod3+1=1
. LCM for segment
[1,1]
is equal to
2
;
boundaries for third query are
(2+2)mod3+1=2
and
(2+3)mod3+1=3
. LCM for segment
[2,3]
is equal to
15
;
boundaries for fourth query are
(15+2)mod3+1=3
and
(15+3)mod3+1=1
. LCM for segment
[1,3]
is equal to
30
.
