In order to celebrate Twice's 5th anniversary, Tzuyu and Sana decided to play a game.
Tzuyu gave Sana two integers
a
and
b
and a really important quest.
In order to complete the quest, Sana has to output the smallest possible value of (
a⊕x
) + (
b⊕x
) for any given
x
, where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(
1≤a,b≤
10
9
).
Output
For each testcase, output the smallest possible value of the given expression.

Note
For the first test case Sana can choose
x=4
and the value will be (
6⊕4
) + (
12⊕4
) =
2+8
=
10
. It can be shown that this is the smallest possible value.
