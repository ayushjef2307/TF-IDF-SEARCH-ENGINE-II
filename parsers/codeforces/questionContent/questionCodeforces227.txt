You are given
n
permutations
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
, each of length
m
. Recall that a permutation of length
m
is a sequence of
m
distinct integers from
1
to
m
.
Let the beauty of a permutation
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
m
be the largest
k
such that
p
1
=1,
p
2
=2,…,
p
k
=k
. If
p
1
≠1
, then the beauty is
0
.
The product of two permutations
p⋅q
is a permutation
r
such that
r
j
=
q
p
j
.
For each
i
from
1
to
n
, print the largest beauty of a permutation
a
i
⋅
a
j
over all
j
from
1
to
n
(possibly,
i=j
).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
4
;
1≤m≤10
) — the number of permutations and the length of each permutation.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains a permutation
a
i
 —
m
distinct integers from
1
to
m
.
The sum of
n
doesn't exceed
5⋅
10
4
over all testcases.
Output
For each testcase, print
n
integers. The
i
-th value should be equal to the largest beauty of a permutation
a
i
⋅
a
j
over all
j
(
1≤j≤n
).
