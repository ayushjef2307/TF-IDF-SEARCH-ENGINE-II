One day, BThero decided to play around with arrays and came up with the following problem:
You are given an array
a
, which consists of
n
positive integers. The array is numerated
1
through
n
. You execute the following procedure exactly once:
You create a new array
b
which consists of
2n
positive integers, where for each
1≤i≤n
the condition
b
2i−1
+
b
2i
=
a
i
holds. For example, for the array
a=[6,8,2]
you can create
b=[2,4,4,4,1,1]
.
You merge consecutive equal numbers in
b
. For example,
b=[2,4,4,4,1,1]
becomes
b=[2,4,1]
.
Find and print the minimum possible value of
|b|
(size of
b
) which can be achieved at the end of the procedure. It can be shown that under the given constraints there is at least one way to construct
b
.
Input
The first line of the input file contains a single integer
T
(
1≤T≤5⋅
10
5
) denoting the number of test cases. The description of
T
test cases follows.
The first line of each test contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
space-separated integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
n
(
2≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that
∑n
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the minimum possible value of
|b|
.
