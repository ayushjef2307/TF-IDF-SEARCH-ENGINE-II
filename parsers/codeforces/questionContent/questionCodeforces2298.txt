Wabbit is playing a game with
n
bosses numbered from
1
to
n
. The bosses can be fought in any order. Each boss needs to be defeated exactly once. There is a parameter called boss bonus which is initially
0
.
When the
i
-th boss is defeated, the current boss bonus is added to Wabbit's score, and then the value of the boss bonus increases by the point increment
c
i
. Note that
c
i
can be negative, which means that other bosses now give fewer points.
However, Wabbit has found a glitch in the game. At any point in time, he can reset the playthrough and start a New Game Plus playthrough. This will set the current boss bonus to
0
, while all defeated bosses remain defeated. The current score is also saved and does not reset to zero after this operation. This glitch can be used at most
k
times. He can reset after defeating any number of bosses (including before or after defeating all of them), and he also can reset the game several times in a row without defeating any boss.
Help Wabbit determine the maximum score he can obtain if he has to defeat all
n
bosses.
Input
The first line of input contains two spaced integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤5⋅

spaced integers
c
1
,
c
2
,…,

≤
c
i
≤

Note
In the first test case, no resets are allowed. An optimal sequence of fights would be
Fight the first boss
(+0)
. Boss bonus becomes equal to
1
.
Fight the second boss
(+1)
. Boss bonus becomes equal to
2
.
Fight the third boss
(+2)
. Boss bonus becomes equal to
3
.
Thus the answer for the first test case is
0+1+2=3
.
In the second test case, it can be shown that one possible optimal sequence of fights is
Fight the fifth boss
(+0)
. Boss bonus becomes equal to
5
.
Fight the first boss
(+5)
. Boss bonus becomes equal to
4
.
Fight the second boss
(+4)
. Boss bonus becomes equal to
2
.
Fight the third boss
(+2)
. Boss bonus becomes equal to
−1
.
Reset. Boss bonus becomes equal to
0
.
Fight the fourth boss
(+0)
. Boss bonus becomes equal to
−4
.
Hence the answer for the second test case is
0+5+4+2+0=11
.
