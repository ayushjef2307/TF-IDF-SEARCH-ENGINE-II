Currently, XXOC's rap is a string consisting of zeroes, ones, and question marks. Unfortunately, haters gonna hate. They will write
x
angry comments for every occurrence of subsequence 01 and
y
angry comments for every occurrence of subsequence 10. You should replace all the question marks with 0 or 1 in such a way that the number of angry comments would be as small as possible.
String
b
is a subsequence of string
a
, if it can be obtained by removing some characters from
a
. Two occurrences of a subsequence are considered distinct if sets of positions of remaining characters are distinct.
Input
The first line contains string
s
 — XXOC's rap (
1≤|s|≤
10
5
). The second line contains two integers
x
and
y
 — the number of angry comments XXOC will recieve for every occurrence of 01 and 10 accordingly (
0≤x,y≤
10
6
).
Output
Output a single integer — the minimum number of angry comments.

Note
In the first example one of the optimum ways to replace is 001. Then there will be
2
subsequences 01 and
0
subsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to
2⋅2+0⋅3=4
.
In the second example one of the optimum ways to replace is 11111. Then there will be
0
subsequences 01 and
0
subsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to
0⋅13+0⋅37=0
.
In the third example one of the optimum ways to replace is 1100. Then there will be
0
subsequences 01 and
4
subsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to
0⋅239+4⋅7=28
.
In the fourth example one of the optimum ways to replace is 01101001. Then there will be
8
subsequences 01 and
8
subsequences 10. Total number of angry comments will be equal to
8⋅5+8⋅7=96
.
