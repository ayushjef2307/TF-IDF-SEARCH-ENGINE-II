We call a positive integer number fair if it is divisible by each of its nonzero digits. For example,
102
is fair (because it is divisible by
1
and
2
), but
282
is not, because it isn't divisible by
8
. Given a positive integer
n
. Find the minimum integer
x
, such that
n≤x
and
x
is fair.
Input
The first line contains number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
3
). Each of the next
t
lines contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
18
).
Output
For each of
t
test cases print a single integer — the least fair number, which is not less than
n
.

Note
Explanations for some test cases:
In the first test case number
1
is fair itself.
In the second test case number
288
is fair (it's divisible by both
2
and
8
). None of the numbers from
[282,287]
is fair, because, for example, none of them is divisible by
8
.
