You are given a positive integer
n
. In one move, you can increase
n
by one (i.e. make
n:=n+1
). Your task is to find the minimum number of moves you need to perform in order to make the sum of digits of
n
be less than or equal to
s
.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains two integers
n
and
s
(
1≤n≤
10
18
;
1≤s≤162
).
Output
For each test case, print the answer: the minimum number of moves you need to perform in order to make the sum of digits of
n
be less than or equal to
s
.
