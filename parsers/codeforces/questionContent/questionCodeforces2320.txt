You are given four integers
a
,
b
,
x
and
y
. Initially,
a≥x
and
b≥y
. You can do the following operation no more than
n
times:
Choose either
a
or
b
and decrease it by one. However, as a result of this operation, value of
a
cannot become less than
x
, and value of
b
cannot become less than
y
.
Your task is to find the minimum possible product of
a
and
b
(
a⋅b
) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than
n
times.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains five integers
a
,
b
,
x
,
y
and
n
(
1≤a,b,x,y,n≤
10
9
). Additional constraint on the input:
a≥x
and
b≥y
always holds.
Output
For each test case, print one integer: the minimum possible product of
a
and
b
(
a⋅b
) you can achieve by applying the given operation no more than
n
times.

Note
In the first test case of the example, you need to decrease
b
three times and obtain
10⋅7=70
.
In the second test case of the example, you need to decrease
a
one time,
b
one time and obtain
11⋅7=77
.
In the sixth test case of the example, you need to decrease
a
five times and obtain
5⋅11=55
.
In the seventh test case of the example, you need to decrease
b
ten times and obtain
10⋅1=10
.
