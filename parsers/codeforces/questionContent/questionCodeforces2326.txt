You are given
m
sets of integers
A
1
,
A
2
,…,
A
m
; elements of these sets are integers between
1
and
n
, inclusive.
There are two arrays of positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
m
and
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
.
In one operation you can delete an element
j
from the set
A
i
and pay
a
i
+
b
j
coins for that.
You can make several (maybe none) operations (some sets can become empty).
After that, you will make an edge-colored undirected graph consisting of
n
vertices. For each set
A
i
you will add an edge
(x,y)
with color
i
for all
x,y∈
A
i
and
x<y
. Some pairs of vertices can be connected with more than one edge, but such edges have different colors.
You call a cycle
i
1
→
e
1
→
i
2
→
e
2
→…→
i
k
→
e
k
→
i
1
(
e
j
is some edge connecting vertices
i
j
and
i
j+1
in this graph) rainbow if all edges on it have different colors.
Find the minimum number of coins you should pay to get a graph without rainbow cycles.
Input
The first line contains two integers
m
and
n
(
1≤m,n≤
10
5
), the number of sets and the number of vertices in the graph.
The second line contains
m
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
m
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
The third line contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤
10
9
).
In the each of the next of
m
lines there are descriptions of sets. In the
i
-th line the first integer
s
i
(
1≤
s
i
≤n
) is equal to the size of
A
i
. Then
s
i
integers follow: the elements of the set
A
i
. These integers are from
1
to
n
and distinct.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
s
i
for all
1≤i≤m
does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
Print one integer: the minimum number of coins you should pay for operations to avoid rainbow cycles in the obtained graph.

Note
In the first test, you can make such operations:
Delete element
1
from set
1
. You should pay
a
1
+
b
1
=5
coins for that.
Delete element
1
from set
2
. You should pay
a
2
+
b
1
=6
coins for that.
You pay
11
coins in total. After these operations, the first and the second sets will be equal to
{2}
and the third set will be equal to
{1,2}
.
So, the graph will consist of one edge
(1,2)
of color
3
.
In the second test, you can make such operations:
Delete element
1
from set
1
. You should pay
a
1
+
b
1
=11
coins for that.
Delete element
4
from set
2
. You should pay
a
2
+
b
4
=13
coins for that.
Delete element
7
from set
3
. You should pay
a
3
+
b
7
=13
coins for that.
Delete element
4
from set
4
. You should pay
a
4
+
b
4
=16
coins for that.
Delete element
7
from set
6
. You should pay
a
6
+
b
7
=13
coins for that.
You pay
66
coins in total.
After these operations, the sets will be:
{2,3}
;
{1}
;
{1,3}
;
{3}
;
{3,4,5,6,7}
;
{5}
;
{8}
.
We will get the graph:
There are no rainbow cycles in it.
