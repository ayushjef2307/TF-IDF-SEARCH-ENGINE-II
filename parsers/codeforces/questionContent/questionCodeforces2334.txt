Alexander is a well-known programmer. Today he decided to finally go out and play football, but with the first hit he left a dent on the new Rolls-Royce of the wealthy businessman Big Vova. Vladimir has recently opened a store on the popular online marketplace "Zmey-Gorynych", and offers Alex a job: if he shows his programming skills by solving a task, he'll work as a cybersecurity specialist. Otherwise, he'll be delivering some doubtful products for the next two years.
You're given
n
positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. Using each of them exactly at once, you're to make such sequence
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
that sequence
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
n
is lexicographically maximal, where
c
i
=GCD(
b
1
,…,
b
i
)
- the greatest common divisor of the first
i
elements of
b
.
Alexander is really afraid of the conditions of this simple task, so he asks you to solve it.
A sequence
a
is lexicographically smaller than a sequence
b
if and only if one of the following holds:
a
is a prefix of
b
, but
a≠b
;
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the sequence
a
has a smaller element than the corresponding element in
b
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
3
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
3
)  — the length of the sequence
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
3
)  — the sequence
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
3
.
Output
For each test case output the answer in a single line  — the desired sequence
b
. If there are multiple answers, print any.

Note
In the first test case of the example, there are only two possible permutations
b
 —
[2,5]
and
[5,2]
: for the first one
c=[2,1]
, for the second one
c=[5,1]
.
In the third test case of the example, number
9
should be the first in
b
, and
GCD(9,3)=3
,
GCD(9,8)=1
, so the second number of
b
should be
3
.
In the seventh test case of the example, first four numbers pairwise have a common divisor (a power of two), but none of them can be the first in the optimal permutation
b
.
