inputstandard input
outputstandard output
This is an interactive problem.
There is an unknown integer
x
(
1≤x≤n
). You want to find
x
.
At first, you have a set of integers
{1,2,…,n}
. You can perform the following operations no more than
10000
times:
A
a
: find how many numbers are multiples of
a
in the current set.
B
a
: find how many numbers are multiples of
a
in this set, and then delete all multiples of
a
, but
x
will never be deleted (even if it is a multiple of
a
). In this operation,
a
must be greater than
1
.
C
a
: it means that you know that
x=a
. This operation can be only performed once.
Remember that in the operation of type B
a>1
must hold.
Write a program, that will find the value of
x
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
). The remaining parts of the input will be given throughout the interaction process.
Interaction
In each round, your program needs to print a line containing one uppercase letter A, B or C and an integer
a
(
1≤a≤n
for operations A and C,
2≤a≤n
for operation B). This line desribes operation you make.
If your operation has type C your program should terminate immediately.
Else your program should read one line containing a single integer, which is the answer to your operation.
After outputting each line, don't forget to flush the output. To do it use:
fflush(stdout) in C/C++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
sys.stdout.flush() in Python;
flush(output) in Pascal;
See the documentation for other languages.
It is guaranteed, that the number
x
is fixed and won't change during the interaction process.
Hacks:
To make a hack, use such input format:
The only line should contain two integers
n
,
x
(
1≤x≤n≤
10
5
).

C 4
Note
Note that to make the sample more clear, we added extra empty lines. You shouldn't print any extra empty lines during the interaction process.
In the first test
n=10
and
x=4
.
Initially the set is:
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
.
In the first operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of
4
and delete them. The answer is
2
because there are two numbers divisible by
4
:
{4,8}
.
8
will be deleted but
4
won't, because the number
x
will never be deleted. Now the set is
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10}
.
In the second operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of
2
. The answer is
4
because there are four numbers divisible by
2
:
{2,4,6,10}
.
In the third operation, you ask how many numbers are multiples of
8
. The answer is
0
because there isn't any number divisible by
8
in the current set.
In the fourth operation, you know that
x=4
, which is the right answer.
