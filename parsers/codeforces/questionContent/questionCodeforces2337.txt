You are given a sequence of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
.
You have to construct two sequences of integers
b
and
c
with length
n
that satisfy:
for every
i
(
1≤i≤n
)
b
i
+
c
i
=
a
i
b
is non-decreasing, which means that for every
1<i≤n
,
b
i
≥
b
i−1
must hold
c
is non-increasing, which means that for every
1<i≤n
,
c
i
≤
c
i−1
must hold
You have to minimize
max(
b
i
,
c
i
)
. In other words, you have to minimize the maximum number in sequences
b
and
c
.
Also there will be
q
changes, the
i
-th change is described by three integers
l,r,x
. You should add
x
to
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
.
You have to find the minimum possible value of
max(
b
i
,
c
i
)
for the initial sequence and for sequence after each change.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The secound line contains
n
integers
a

a
i

).
The third line contains an integer
q
(
1≤q≤
10

).
Each of the next
q
lines contains three integers
l,r,x
(
1≤l≤r≤n,−

), desribing the next change.
Output
Print
q+1
lines.
On the
i
-th (
1≤i≤q+1
) line, print the answer to the problem for the sequence after
i−1
changes.

Note
In the first test:
The initial sequence
a=(2,−1,7,3)
. Two sequences
b=(−3,−3,5,5),c=(5,2,2,−2)
is a possible choice.
After the first change
a=(2,−4,4,0)
. Two sequences
b=(−3,−3,5,5),c=(5,−1,−1,−5)
is a possible choice.
After the second change
a=(2,−4,6,2)
. Two sequences
b=(−4,−4,6,6),c=(6,0,0,−4)
is a possible choice.
