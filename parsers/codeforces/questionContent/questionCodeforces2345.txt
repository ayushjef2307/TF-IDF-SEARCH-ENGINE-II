Let
a
1
,…,
a
n
be an array of
n
positive integers. In one operation, you can choose an index
i
such that
a
i
=i
, and remove
a
i
from the array (after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).
The weight of
a
is defined as the maximum number of elements you can remove.
You must answer
q
independent queries
(x,y)
: after replacing the
x
first elements of
a
and the
y
last elements of
a
by
n+1
(making them impossible to remove), what would be the weight of
a
?
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤3⋅
10
5
)  — the length of the array and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
) — elements of the array.
The
i
-th of the next
q
lines contains two integers
x
and
y
(
x,y≥0
and
x+y<n
).
Output
Print
q
lines,
i
-th line should contain a single integer  — the answer to the
i
-th query.

Note
Explanation of the first query:
After making first
x=3
and last
y=1
elements impossible to remove,
a
becomes
[×,×,×,9,5,4,6,5,7,8,3,11,×]
(we represent
14
as
×
for clarity).
Here is a strategy that removes
5
elements (the element removed is colored in red):
[×,×,×,9,5,4,6,5,7,8,3,11,×]
[×,×,×,9,4,6,5,7,8,3,11,×]
[×,×,×,9,4,6,5,7,8,3,×]
[×,×,×,9,4,5,7,8,3,×]
[×,×,×,9,4,5,7,3,×]
[×,×,×,9,4,5,3,×]
(final state)
It is impossible to remove more than
5
elements, hence the weight is
5
.
