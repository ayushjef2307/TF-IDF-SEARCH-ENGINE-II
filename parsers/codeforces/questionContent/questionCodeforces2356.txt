You are given a tree that consists of
n
nodes. You should label each of its
n−1
edges with an integer in such way that satisfies the following conditions:
each integer must be greater than
0
;
the product of all
n−1
numbers should be equal to
k
;
the number of
1
-s among all
n−1
integers must be minimum possible.
Let's define
f(u,v)
as the sum of the numbers on the simple path from node
u
to node
v
. Also, let
∑
i=1
n−1
∑
j=i+1
n
f(i,j)
be a distribution index of the tree.
Find the maximum possible distribution index you can get. Since answer can be too large, print it modulo
10
9
+7
.
In this problem, since the number
k
can be large, the result of the prime factorization of
k
is given instead.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the next
n−1
lines describes an edge: the
i
-th line contains two integers
u
i
and
v
i
(
1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n
;
u
i
≠
v
i
) — indices of vertices connected by the
i
-th edge.
Next line contains a single integer
m
(
1≤m≤6⋅
10
4
) — the number of prime factors of
k
.
Next line contains
m
prime numbers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
m
(
2≤
p
i
<6⋅
10
4
) such that
k=
p
1
⋅
p

⋅…⋅
p
m
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
10
5
, the sum of
m
over all test cases doesn't exceed
6⋅
10
4
, and the given edges for each test cases form a tree.
Output
Print the maximum distribution index you can get. Since answer can be too large, print it modulo
10

Note
In the first test case, one of the optimal ways is on the following image:
In this case,
f(1,2)=1
,
f(1,3)=3
,
f(1,4)=5
,
f(2,3)=2
,
f(2,4)=4
,
f(3,4)=2
, so the sum of these
6
numbers is
17
.
In the second test case, one of the optimal ways is on the following image:
In this case,
f(1,2)=3
,
f(1,3)=1
,
f(1,4)=4
,
f(2,3)=2
,
f(2,4)=5
,
f(3,4)=3
, so the sum of these
6
numbers is
18
.
