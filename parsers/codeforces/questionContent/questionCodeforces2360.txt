Polycarp plays a (yet another!) strategic computer game. In this game, he leads an army of mercenaries.
Polycarp wants to gather his army for a quest. There are
n
mercenaries for hire, and the army should consist of some subset of them.
The
i
-th mercenary can be chosen if the resulting number of chosen mercenaries is not less than
l
i
(otherwise he deems the quest to be doomed) and not greater than
r
i
(he doesn't want to share the trophies with too many other mercenaries). Furthermore,
m
pairs of mercenaries hate each other and cannot be chosen for the same quest.
How many non-empty subsets does Polycarp need to consider? In other words, calculate the number of non-empty subsets of mercenaries such that the size of this subset belongs to
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
for each chosen mercenary, and there are no two mercenaries in the subset that hate each other.
The answer may be large, so calculate it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤3⋅
10
5
,
0≤m≤min(20,
n(n−1)
2
)
) — the number of mercenaries and the number of pairs of mercenaries that hate each other.
Then
n
lines follow, the
i
-th of them contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
).
Then
m
lines follow, the
i
-th of them contains two integers
a
i
and
b
i
(
1≤
a
i
<
b
i
≤n
) denoting that the mercenaries
a
i
and
b
i
hate each other. There are no two equal pairs in this list.
Output
Print one integer — the number of non-empty subsets meeting the constraints, taken modulo
998244353
.
