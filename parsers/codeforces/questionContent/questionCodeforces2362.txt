You have a multiset containing several integers. Initially, it contains
a
1
elements equal to
1
,
a
2
elements equal to
2
, ...,
a
n
elements equal to
n
.
You may apply two types of operations:
choose two integers
l
and
r
(
l≤r
), then remove one occurrence of
l
, one occurrence of
l+1
, ..., one occurrence of
r
from the multiset. This operation can be applied only if each number from
l
to
r
occurs at least once in the multiset;
choose two integers
i
and
x
(
x≥1
), then remove
x
occurrences of
i
from the multiset. This operation can be applied only if the multiset contains at least
x
occurrences of
i
.
What is the minimum number of operations required to delete all elements from the multiset?
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤5000
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
Output
Print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to delete all elements from the multiset.
