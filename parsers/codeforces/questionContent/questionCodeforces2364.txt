Consider the following process. You have a binary string (a string where each character is either 0 or 1)
w
of length
n
and an integer
x
. You build a new binary string
s
consisting of
n
characters. The
i
-th character of
s
is chosen as follows:
if the character
w
i−x
exists and is equal to 1, then
s
i
is 1 (formally, if
i>x
and
w
i−x
=
1, then
s
i
=
1);
if the character
w
i+x
exists and is equal to 1, then
s
i
is 1 (formally, if
i+x≤n
and
w
i+x
=
1, then
s
i
=
1);
if both of the aforementioned conditions are false, then
s
i
is 0.
You are given the integer
x
and the resulting string
s
. Reconstruct the original string
w
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the resulting string
s
(
2≤|s|≤
10
5
, each character of
s
is either 0 or 1). The second line contains one integer
x
(
1≤x≤|s|−1
).
The total length of all strings
s
in the input does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print the answer on a separate line as follows:
if no string
w
can produce the string
s
at the end of the process, print
−1
;
otherwise, print the binary string
w
consisting of
|s|
characters. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
