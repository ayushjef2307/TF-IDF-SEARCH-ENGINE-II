Alice and Bob play a game. They have a binary string
s
(a string such that each character in it is either
0
or
1
). Alice moves first, then Bob, then Alice again, and so on.
During their move, the player can choose any number (not less than one) of consecutive equal characters in
s
and delete them.
For example, if the string is
10110
, there are
6
possible moves (deleted characters are bold):
10110→0110
;
10110→1110
;
10110→1010
;
10110→1010
;
10110→100
;
10110→1011
.
After the characters are removed, the characters to the left and to the right of the removed block become adjacent. I. e. the following sequence of moves is valid:
10110→100→1
.
The game ends when the string becomes empty, and the score of each player is the number of
1
-characters deleted by them.
Each player wants to maximize their score. Calculate the resulting score of Alice.
Input
The first line contains one integer
T
(
1≤T≤500
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case contains exactly one line containing a binary string
s
(
1≤|s|≤100
).
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the resulting score of Alice (the number of
1
-characters deleted by her).
