You are given an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
, which is sorted in non-decreasing order (
a
i
≤
a
i+1
)
.
Find three indices
i
,
j
,
k
such that
1≤i<j<k≤n
and it is impossible to construct a non-degenerate triangle (a triangle with nonzero area) having sides equal to
a
i
,
a
j
and
a
k
(for example it is possible to construct a non-degenerate triangle with sides
3
,
4
and
5
but impossible with sides
3
,
4
and
7
). If it is impossible to find such triple, report it.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤5⋅
10
4
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
;
a
i−1
≤
a
i
) — the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print the answer to it in one line.
If there is a triple of indices
i
,
j
,
k
(
i<j<k
) such that it is impossible to construct a non-degenerate triangle having sides equal to
a
i
,
a
j
and
a
k
, print that three indices in ascending order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
Otherwise, print -1.

Note
In the first test case it is impossible with sides
6
,
11
and
18
. Note, that this is not the only correct answer.
In the second test case you always can construct a non-degenerate triangle.
