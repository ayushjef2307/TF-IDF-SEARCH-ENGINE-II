 — Boboniu
Boboniu has issued his currencies, named Bobo Yuan. Bobo Yuan (BBY) is a series of currencies. Boboniu gives each of them a positive integer identifier, such as BBY-1, BBY-2, etc.
Boboniu has a BBY collection. His collection looks like a sequence. For example:
We can use sequence
a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1]
of length
n=9
to denote it.
Now Boboniu wants to fold his collection. You can imagine that Boboniu stick his collection to a long piece of paper and fold it between currencies:
Boboniu will only fold the same identifier of currencies together. In other words, if
a
i
is folded over
a
j
(
1≤i,j≤n
), then
a
i
=
a
j
must hold. Boboniu doesn't care if you follow this rule in the process of folding. But once it is finished, the rule should be obeyed.
A formal definition of fold is described in notes.
According to the picture above, you can fold
a
two times. In fact, you can fold
a=[1,2,3,3,2,1,4,4,1]
at most two times. So the maximum number of folds of it is
2
.
As an international fan of Boboniu, you're asked to calculate the maximum number of folds.
You're given a sequence
a
of length
n
, for each
i
(
1≤i≤n
), you need to calculate the maximum number of folds of
[
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
i
]
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
).
Output
Print
n
integers. The
i
-th of them should be equal to the maximum number of folds of
[
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
i
]
.

Note
Formally, for a sequence
a
of length
n
, let's define the folding sequence as a sequence
b
of length
n
such that:
b
i
(
1≤i≤n
) is either
1
or
−1
.
Let
p(i)=[
b
i
=1]+
∑
i−1
j=1
b
j
. For all
1≤i<j≤n
, if
p(i)=p(j)
, then
a
i
should be equal to
a
j
.
(
[A]
is the value of boolean expression
A
. i. e.
[A]=1
if
A
is true, else
[A]=0
).
Now we define the number of folds of
b
as
f(b)=
∑
n−1
i=1
[
b
i
≠
b
i+1
]
.
The maximum number of folds of
a
is
F(a)=max{f(b)∣b is a folding sequence of a}
.
