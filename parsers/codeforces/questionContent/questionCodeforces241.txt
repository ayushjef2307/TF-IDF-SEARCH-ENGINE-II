Vlad found two positive numbers
a
and
b
(
a,b>0
). He discovered that
a⊕b=
a+b
2
, where
⊕
means the bitwise exclusive OR , and division is performed without rounding..
Since it is easier to remember one number than two, Vlad remembered only
a⊕b
, let's denote this number as
x
. Help him find any suitable
a
and
b
or tell him that they do not exist.
Input
The first line of the input data contains the single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases in the test.
Each test case is described by a single integer
x
(
1≤x≤
2
29
) — the number that Vlad remembered.
Output
Output
t
lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As the answer, output
a
and
b
(
0<a,b≤
2
32
), such that
x=a⊕b=
a+b
2
. If there are several answers, output any of them. If there are no matching pairs, output -1.
