Lord Omkar has permitted you to enter the Holy Church of Omkar! To test your worthiness, Omkar gives you a password which you must interpret!
A password is an array
a
of
n
positive integers. You apply the following operation to the array: pick any two adjacent numbers that are not equal to each other and replace them with their sum. Formally, choose an index
i
such that
1≤i<n
and
a
i
≠
a
i+1
, delete both
a
i
and
a
i+1
from the array and put
a
i
+
a
i+1
in their place.
For example, for array
[7,4,3,7]
you can choose
i=2
and the array will become
[7,4+3,7]=[7,7,7]
. Note that in this array you can't apply this operation anymore.
Notice that one operation will decrease the size of the password by
1
. What is the shortest possible length of the password after some number (possibly
0
) of operations?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the password.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the initial contents of your password.
The sum of
n
over all test cases will not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each password, print one integer: the shortest possible length of the password after some number of operations.

Note
In the first test case, you can do the following to achieve a length of
1
:
Pick
i=2
to get
[2,4,1]
Pick
i=1
to get
[6,1]
Pick
i=1
to get
[7]
In the second test case, you can't perform any operations because there is no valid
i
that satisfies the requirements mentioned above.
