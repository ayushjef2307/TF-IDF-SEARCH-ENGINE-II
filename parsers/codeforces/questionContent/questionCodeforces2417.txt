You are given
n
segments
[
l
1
,
r
1
],[
l
2
,
r
2
],…,[
l
n
,
r
n
]
. Each segment has one of two colors: the
i
-th segment's color is
t
i
.
Let's call a pair of segments
i
and
j
bad if the following two conditions are met:
t
i
≠
t
j
;
the segments
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
and
[
l
j
,
r
j
]
intersect, embed or touch, i. e. there exists an integer
x
such that
x∈[
l
i
,
r
i
]
and
x∈[
l
j
,
r
j
]
.
Calculate the maximum number of segments that can be selected from the given ones, so that there is no bad pair among the selected ones.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — number of segments.
The next
n
lines contains three integers
l
i
,
r
i
,
t
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤
10
9
;
t
i
∈{1,2}
) — description of the
i
-th segment.
Output
Print the maximum number of segments that can be selected, so that there is no bad pair among the selected segments.
