You are given a table
a
of size
2×n
(i.e. two rows and
n
columns) consisting of integers from
1
to
n
.
In one move, you can choose some column
j
(
1≤j≤n
) and swap values
a
1,j
and
a
2,j
in it. Each column can be chosen no more than once.
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain permutations of size
n
in both first and second rows of the table or determine if it is impossible to do that.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Recall that the permutation of size
n
is such an array of size
n
that contains each integer from
1
to
n
exactly once (the order of elements doesn't matter).
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of columns in the table. The second line of the test case contains
n
integers
a
1,1
,
a
1,2
,…,
a
1,n
(
1≤
a
1,i
≤n
), where
a
1,i
is the
i
-th element of the first row of the table. The third line of the test case contains
n
integers
a
2,1
,
a
2,2
,…,
a
2,n
(
1≤
a
2,i
≤n
), where
a
2,i
is the
i
-th element of the second row of the table.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
(
∑n≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
For each test case print the answer: -1 if it is impossible to obtain permutation of size
n
in both first and the second rows of the table, or one integer
k
in the first line, where
k
is the minimum number of moves required to obtain permutations in both rows, and
k
distinct integers

) in any order — indices of columns in which you need to swap values to obtain permutations in both rows. If there are several answers, you can print any.
