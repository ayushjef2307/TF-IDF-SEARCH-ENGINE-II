Taisia has
n
six-sided dice. Each face of the die is marked with a number from
1
to
6
, each number from
1
to
6
is used once.
Taisia rolls all
n
dice at the same time and gets a sequence of values
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤6
), where
a
i
is the value on the upper face of the
i
-th dice. The sum of this sequence is equal to
s
.
Suddenly, Taisia's pet cat steals exactly one dice with maximum value
a
i
and calculates the sum of the values on the remaining
n−1
dice, which is equal to
r
.
You only know the number of dice
n
and the values of
s
,
r
. Restore a possible sequence
a
that fulfills the constraints.
Input
The first line contains the integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of testcases.
Each testcase is given on a separate line and contains three integers
n
,
s
,
r
(
2≤n≤50
,
1≤r<s≤300
).
It is guaranteed that a solution exists.
Output
For each testcase, print:
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
in any order. It is guaranteed that such sequence exists.
If there are multiple solutions, print any.
