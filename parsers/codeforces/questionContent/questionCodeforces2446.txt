Koa the Koala has a binary string
s
of length
n
. Koa can perform no more than
n−1
(possibly zero) operations of the following form:
In one operation Koa selects positions
i
and
i+1
for some
i
with
1≤i<|s|
and sets
s
i
to
max(
s
i
,
s
i+1
)
. Then Koa deletes position
i+1
from
s
(after the removal, the remaining parts are concatenated).
Note that after every operation the length of
s
decreases by
1
.
How many different binary strings can Koa obtain by doing no more than
n−1
(possibly zero) operations modulo
10
9
+7
(
1000000007
)?
Input
The only line of input contains binary string
s
(
1≤|s|≤
10
6
). For all
i
(
1≤i≤|s|
)
s
i
=0
or
s
i
=1
.
Output
On a single line print the answer to the problem modulo
10
9
+7
(
1000000007
).

Note
In the first sample Koa can obtain binary strings:
0
,
00
and
000
.
In the second sample Koa can obtain binary strings:
1
,
01
,
11
,
011
,
101
and
0101
. For example:
to obtain
01
from
0101
Koa can operate as follows:
0101→0(10)1→011→0(11)→01
.
to obtain
11
from
0101
Koa can operate as follows:
0101→(01)01→101→1(01)→11
.
Parentheses denote the two positions Koa selected in each operation.
