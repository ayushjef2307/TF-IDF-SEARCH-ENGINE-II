Note that the only difference between String Transformation 1 and String Transformation 2 is in the move Koa does. In this version the letter
y
Koa selects must be strictly greater alphabetically than
x
(read statement for better understanding). You can make hacks in these problems independently.
Koa the Koala has two strings
A
and
B
of the same length
n
(
|A|=|B|=n
) consisting of the first
20
lowercase English alphabet letters (ie. from a to t).
In one move Koa:
selects some subset of positions
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
k
(
k≥1;1≤
p
i
≤n;
p
i
≠
p
j
if
i≠j
) of
A
such that
A
p
1
=
A
p
2
=…=
A
p
k
=x
(ie. all letters on this positions are equal to some letter
x
).
selects a letter
y
(from the first
20
lowercase letters in English alphabet) such that
y>x
(ie. letter
y
is strictly greater alphabetically than
x
).
sets each letter in positions
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
k
to letter
y
. More formally: for each
i
(
1≤i≤k
) Koa sets
A
p
i
=y
.
Note that you can only modify letters in string
A
.
Koa wants to know the smallest number of moves she has to do to make strings equal to each other (
A=B
) or to determine that there is no way to make them equal. Help her!
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains
t
(
1≤t≤10
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of strings
A
and
B
.
The second line of each test case contains string
A
(
|A|=n
).
The third line of each test case contains string
B
(
|B|=n
).
Both strings consists of the first
20
lowercase English alphabet letters (ie. from a to t).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case:
Print on a single line the smallest number of moves she has to do to make strings equal to each other (
A=B
) or
−1
if there is no way to make them equal.

Note
In the
1
-st test case Koa:
selects positions
1
and
2
and sets
A
1
=
A
2
=
b (
aab→bbb
).
selects positions
2
and
3
and sets
A
2
=
A
3
=
c (
bbb→bcc
).
In the
2
-nd test case Koa has no way to make string
A
equal
B
.
In the
3
-rd test case Koa:
selects position
1
and sets
A
1
=
t (
abc→tbc
).
selects position
2
and sets
A
2
=
s (
tbc→tsc
).
selects position
3
and sets
A
3
=
r (
tsc→tsr
).
