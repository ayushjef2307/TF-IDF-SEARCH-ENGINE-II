Serval loves Brain Power and his brain power problem.
Serval defines that a string
T
is powerful iff
T
can be obtained by concatenating some string
T
′
multiple times. Formally speaking,
T
is powerful iff there exist a string
T
′
and an integer
k≥2
such that
T=
T
′
+
T
′
+⋯+
T

For example, gogogo is powerful because it can be obtained by concatenating go three times, but power is not powerful.
Serval has a string
S
consists of lowercase English letters. He is curious about the longest powerful subsequence of
S
, and he only needs you to find out the length of it. If all the non-empty subsequences of
S
is not powerful, the answer is considered to be
0
.
A string
a
is a subsequence of a string
b
if
a
can be obtained from
b
by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.
Input
The first line contains a single string
S
(
|S|≤80
) consisting of lowercase English letters.
Output
Print a single integer — the length of the longest powerful subsequence of
S
. If all the non-empty subsequences of
S
is not powerful, print
0
.

Note
For the first sample, all of the non-empty subsequences of buaa are listed below:
b
u
a (occurred twice, buaa and buaa)
bu
ba (occurred twice, buaa and buaa)
ua (occurred twice, buaa and buaa)
aa
bua (occurred twice, buaa and buaa )
baa
uaa
buaa
Since
aa=a+a
, aa is a powerful subsequence. It can be shown that aa is the only powerful subsequence among them. So the answer is
2
.
For the second sample, the longest powerful subsequence is codcod from codeforcesround. So the answer is
6
.
