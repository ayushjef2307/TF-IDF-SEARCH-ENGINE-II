There are
n
programmers that you want to split into several non-empty teams. The skill of the
i
-th programmer is
a
i
. You want to assemble the maximum number of teams from them. There is a restriction for each team: the number of programmers in the team multiplied by the minimum skill among all programmers in the team must be at least
x
.
Each programmer should belong to at most one team. Some programmers may be left without a team.
Calculate the maximum number of teams that you can assemble.
Input
The first line contains the integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
x
(
1≤n≤
10
5
;1≤x≤
10
9
) — the number of programmers and the restriction of team skill respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
), where
a
i
is the skill of the
i
-th programmer.
The sum of
n
over all inputs does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print one integer — the maximum number of teams that you can assemble.
