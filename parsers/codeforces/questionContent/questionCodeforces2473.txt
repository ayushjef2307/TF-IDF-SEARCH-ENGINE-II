1
,
a
⃗ 
2
,…,
a
⃗ 
n
}
of integer points,
i
-th point has coordinates
a
i
=(
x
i
;
y
i
;
z
i
)
. Let
g
i
=gcd(
x
i
,
y
i
,
z
i
)
. It is guaranteed that
gcd(
g
1
,
g
2
,…,
g
n
)=1
.
You have to find a cubic lattice
L
such that
A⊂L
and
r
is the maximum possible.
Input
First line contains single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
4
) — the number of points in
A
.
The
i
-th of the following
n
lines contains integers
x
i
,
y
i
,
z
i
(
0<
x
2
i
+
y
2
i
+
z
2
i
≤
10
16
) — coordinates of the
i
-th point.
It is guaranteed that
gcd(
g
1
,
g
2
,…,
g
n
)=1
where
g
i
=gcd(
x
i
,
y

)
.
Output
In first line output a single integer
r
2
, the square of maximum possible
r
.
In following
3
lines output coordinates of vectors
r

,
r
⃗ 
2
→
and
r
⃗ 
3
→
respectively.
If there are multiple possible answers, output any.
