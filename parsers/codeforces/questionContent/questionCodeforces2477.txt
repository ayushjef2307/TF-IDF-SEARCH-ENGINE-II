Madeline has an array
a
of
n
integers. A pair
(u,v)
of integers forms an inversion in
a
if:
1≤u<v≤n
.
a
u
>
a
v
.
Madeline recently found a magical paper, which allows her to write two indices
u
and
v
and swap the values
a
u
and
a
v
. Being bored, she decided to write a list of pairs
(
u
i
,
v
i
)
with the following conditions:
all the pairs in the list are distinct and form an inversion in
a
.
all the pairs that form an inversion in
a
are in the list.
Starting from the given array, if you swap the values at indices
u
1
and
v
1
, then the values at indices
u
2
and
v
2
and so on, then after all pairs are processed, the array
a
will be sorted in non-decreasing order.
Construct such a list or determine that no such list exists. If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤1000
) — the length of the array.
Next line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,...,
a
n
(1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
)
 — elements of the array.
Output
Print -1 if no such list exists. Otherwise in the first line you should print a single integer
m
(
0≤m≤
n(n−1)
2
) — number of pairs in the list.
The
i
-th of the following
m
lines should contain two integers
u
i
,
v
i
(
1≤
u
i
<
v
i
≤n
).
If there are multiple possible answers, you may find any of them.

Note
In the first sample test case the array will change in this order
[3,1,2]→[2,1,3]→[1,2,3]
.
In the second sample test case it will be
[1,8,1,6]→[1,6,1,8]→[1,1,6,8]
.
In the third sample test case the array is already sorted.
