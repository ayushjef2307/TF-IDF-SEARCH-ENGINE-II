Serval has two
n
-bit binary integer numbers
a
and
b
. He wants to share those numbers with Toxel.
Since Toxel likes the number
b
more, Serval decides to change
a
into
b
by some (possibly zero) operations. In an operation, Serval can choose any positive integer
k
between
1
and
n
, and change
a
into one of the following number:
a⊕(a≪k)
a⊕(a≫k)
In other words, the operation moves every bit of
a
left or right by
k
positions, where the overflowed bits are removed, and the missing bits are padded with
0
. The bitwise XOR of the shift result and the original
a
is assigned back to
a
.
Serval does not have much time. He wants to perform no more than
n
operations to change
a
into
b
. Please help him to find out an operation sequence, or determine that it is impossible to change
a
into
b
in at most
n
operations. You do not need to minimize the number of operations.
In this problem,
x⊕y
denotes the bitwise XOR operation of
x
and
y
.
a≪k
and
a≫k
denote the logical left shift and logical right shift.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
3
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
3
) — the number of bits in numbers
a
and
b
.
The second and the third line of each test case contain a binary string of length
n
, representing
a
and
b
, respectively. The strings contain only characters 0 and 1.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
3
.
Output
For each test case, if it is impossible to change
a
into
b
in at most
n
operations, print a single integer
−1
.
Otherwise, in the first line, print the number of operations
m
(
0≤m≤n
).
If
m>0
, in the second line, print
m
integers
k
1
,
k
2
,…,
k
m
representing the operations. If
1≤
k
i
≤n
, it means logical left shift
a
by
k
i
positions. If
−n≤
k
i
≤−1
, it means logical right shift
a
by
−
k
i
positions.
If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

The first operation changes
a
into
00111⊕

The second operation changes

.
The bits with strikethroughs are overflowed bits that are removed. The bits with underline are padded bits.
In the second test case,
a
is already equal to
b
, so no operations are needed.
In the third test case, it can be shown that
a
cannot be changed into
b
.
