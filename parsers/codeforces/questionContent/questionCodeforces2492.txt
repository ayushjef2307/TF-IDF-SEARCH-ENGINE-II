You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers. Indices of the array start from zero (i. e. the first element is
a
0
, the second one is
a
1
, and so on).
You can reverse at most one subarray (continuous subsegment) of this array. Recall that the subarray of
a
with borders
l
and
r
is
a[l;r]=
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
.
Your task is to reverse such a subarray that the sum of elements on even positions of the resulting array is maximized (i. e. the sum of elements
a
0
,
a
2
,…,
a
2k
for integer
k=⌊
n−1
2
⌋
should be maximum possible).
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of
a
. The second line of the test case contains
n
integers
a
0
,
a
1
,…,
a
n−1
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
), where
a
i
is the
i
-th element of
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
(
∑n≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
For each test case, print the answer on the separate line — the maximum possible sum of elements on even positions after reversing at most one subarray (continuous subsegment) of
a
.
