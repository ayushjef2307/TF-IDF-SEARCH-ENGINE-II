Ashish has an array
a
of size
n
.
A subsequence of
a
is defined as a sequence that can be obtained from
a
by deleting some elements (possibly none), without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Consider a subsequence
s
of
a
. He defines the cost of
s
as the minimum between:
The maximum among all elements at odd indices of
s
.
The maximum among all elements at even indices of
s
.
Note that the index of an element is its index in
s
, rather than its index in
a
. The positions are numbered from
1
. So, the cost of
s
is equal to
min(max(
s
1
,
s
3
,
s
5
,…),max(
s
2
,
s
4
,
s
6
,…))
.
For example, the cost of
{7,5,6}
is
min(max(7,6),max(5))=min(7,5)=5
.
Help him find the minimum cost of a subsequence of size
k
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤k≤n≤2⋅
10
5
)  — the size of the array
a
and the size of the subsequence.
The next line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
)  — the elements of the array
a
.
Output
Output a single integer  — the minimum cost of a subsequence of size
k
.

Note
In the first test, consider the subsequence
s
=
{1,3}
. Here the cost is equal to
min(max(1),max(3))=1
.
In the second test, consider the subsequence
s
=
{1,2,4}
. Here the cost is equal to
min(max(1,4),max(2))=2
.
In the fourth test, consider the subsequence
s
=
{3,50,2,4}
. Here the cost is equal to
min(max(3,2),max(50,4))=3
.
