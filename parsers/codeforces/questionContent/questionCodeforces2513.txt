Ashishgup and FastestFinger play a game.
They start with a number
n
and play in turns. In each turn, a player can make any one of the following moves:
Divide
n
by any of its odd divisors greater than
1
.
Subtract
1
from
n
if
n
is greater than
1
.
Divisors of a number include the number itself.
The player who is unable to make a move loses the game.
Ashishgup moves first. Determine the winner of the game if both of them play optimally.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer  —
n
(
1≤n≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, print "Ashishgup" if he wins, and "FastestFinger" otherwise (without quotes).

Note
In the first test case,
n=1
, Ashishgup cannot make a move. He loses.
In the second test case,
n=2
, Ashishgup subtracts
1
on the first move. Now
n=1
, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.
In the third test case,
n=3
, Ashishgup divides by
3
on the first move. Now
n=1
, FastestFinger cannot make a move, so he loses.
In the last test case,
n=12
, Ashishgup divides it by
3
. Now
n=4
, FastestFinger is forced to subtract
1
, and Ashishgup gets
3
, so he wins by dividing it by
3
.
