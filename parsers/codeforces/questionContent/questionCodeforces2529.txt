Karl likes Codeforces and subsequences. He wants to find a string of lowercase English letters that contains at least
k
subsequences codeforces. Out of all possible strings, Karl wants to find a shortest one.
Formally, a codeforces subsequence of a string
s
is a subset of ten characters of
s
that read codeforces from left to right. For example, codeforces contains codeforces a single time, while codeforcesisawesome contains codeforces four times: codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome, codeforcesisawesome.
Help Karl find any shortest string that contains at least
k
codeforces subsequences.
Input
The only line contains a single integer
k
(
1≤k≤
10
16
)
.
Output
Print a shortest string of lowercase English letters that contains at least
k
codeforces subsequences. If there are several such strings, print any of them.
