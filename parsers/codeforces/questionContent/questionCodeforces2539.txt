You are given a simple weighted connected undirected graph, consisting of
n
vertices and
m
edges.
A path in the graph of length
k
is a sequence of
k+1
vertices
v
1
,
v
2
,…,
v
k+1
such that for each
i
(1≤i≤k)
the edge
(
v
i
,
v
i+1
)
is present in the graph. A path from some vertex
v
also has vertex
v
1
=v
. Note that edges and vertices are allowed to be included in the path multiple times.
The weight of the path is the total weight of edges in it.
For each
i
from
1
to
q
consider a path from vertex
1
of length
i
of the maximum weight. What is the sum of weights of these
q
paths?
Answer can be quite large, so print it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The first line contains a three integers
n
,
m
,
q
(
2≤n≤2000
;
n−1≤m≤2000
;
m≤q≤
10
9
) — the number of vertices in the graph, the number of edges in the graph and the number of lengths that should be included in the answer.
Each of the next
m
lines contains a description of an edge: three integers
v
,
u
,
w
(
1≤v,u≤n
;
1≤w≤
10
6
) — two vertices
v
and
u
are connected by an undirected edge with weight
w
. The graph contains no loops and no multiple edges. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a connected graph.
Output
Print a single integer — the sum of the weights of the paths from vertex
1
of maximum weights of lengths
1,2,…,q
modulo
10

+7
.

Note
Here is the graph for the first example:
Some maximum weight paths are:
length
1
: edges
(1,7)
 — weight
3
;
length
2
: edges
(1,2),(2,3)
 — weight
1+10=11
;
length
3
: edges
(1,5),(5,6),(6,4)
 — weight
2+7+15=24
;
length
4
: edges
(1,5),(5,6),(6,4),(6,4)
 — weight
2+7+15+15=39
;
…
So the answer is the sum of
25
terms:
3+11+24+39+…
In the second example the maximum weight paths have weights
4
,
8
,
12
,
16
and
20
.
