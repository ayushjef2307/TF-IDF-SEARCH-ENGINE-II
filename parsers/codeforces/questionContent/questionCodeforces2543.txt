You are given an array consisting of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
n
. Initially
a
x
=1
, all other elements are equal to
0
.
You have to perform
m
operations. During the
i
-th operation, you choose two indices
c
and
d
such that
l
i
≤c,d≤
r
i
, and swap
a
c
and
a
d
.
Calculate the number of indices
k
such that it is possible to choose the operations so that
a
k
=1
in the end.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. Then the description of
t
testcases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
x
and
m
(
1≤n≤
10
9
;
1≤m≤100
;
1≤x≤n
).
Each of next
m
lines contains the descriptions of the operations; the
i
-th line contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
).
Output
For each test case print one integer — the number of indices
k
such that it is possible to choose the operations so that
a
k
=1
in the end.

Note
In the first test case, it is possible to achieve
a
k
=1
for every
k
. To do so, you may use the following operations:
swap
a
k
and
a
4
;
swap
a
2
and
a
2
;
swap
a
5
and
a
5
.
In the second test case, only
k=1
and
k=2
are possible answers. To achieve
a
1
=1
, you have to swap
a
1
and
a
1
during the second operation. To achieve
a
2
=1
, you have to swap
a
1
and
a
2
during the second operation.
