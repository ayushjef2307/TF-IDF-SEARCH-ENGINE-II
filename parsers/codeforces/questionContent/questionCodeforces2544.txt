Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). In this game, he can craft tools of two types — shovels and swords. To craft a shovel, Polycarp spends two sticks and one diamond; to craft a sword, Polycarp spends two diamonds and one stick.
Each tool can be sold for exactly one emerald. How many emeralds can Polycarp earn, if he has
a
sticks and
b
diamonds?
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(
0≤a,b≤
10
9
) — the number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively.
Output
For each test case print one integer — the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn.

Note
In the first test case Polycarp can earn two emeralds as follows: craft one sword and one shovel.
In the second test case Polycarp does not have any diamonds, so he cannot craft anything.
