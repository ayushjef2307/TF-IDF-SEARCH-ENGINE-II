Ridhiman challenged Ashish to find the maximum valued subsequence of an array $$$a$$$ of size $$$n$$$ consisting of positive integers.
The value of a non-empty subsequence of $$$k$$$ elements of $$$a$$$ is defined as $$$\sum 2^i$$$ over all integers $$$i \ge 0$$$ such that at least $$$\max(1, k - 2)$$$ elements of the subsequence have the $$$i$$$-th bit set in their binary representation (value $$$x$$$ has the $$$i$$$-th bit set in its binary representation if $$$\lfloor \frac{x}{2^i} \rfloor \mod 2$$$ is equal to $$$1$$$).
Recall that $$$b$$$ is a subsequence of $$$a$$$, if $$$b$$$ can be obtained by deleting some(possibly zero) elements from $$$a$$$.
Help Ashish find the maximum value he can get by choosing some subsequence of $$$a$$$.
Input
The first line of the input consists of a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \le n \le 500)$$$ — the size of $$$a$$$.
The next line consists of $$$n$$$ space-separated integers — the elements of the array $$$(1 \le a_i \le 10^{18})$$$.
Output
Print a single integer — the maximum value Ashish can get by choosing some subsequence of $$$a$$$.

Note
For the first test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $$$\{{2, 3}\}$$$ of size $$$2$$$. The binary representation of $$$2$$$ is 10 and that of $$$3$$$ is 11. Since $$$\max(k - 2, 1)$$$ is equal to $$$1$$$, the value of the subsequence is $$$2^0 + 2^1$$$ (both $$$2$$$ and $$$3$$$ have $$$1$$$-st bit set in their binary representation and $$$3$$$ has $$$0$$$-th bit set in its binary representation). Note that he could also pick the subsequence $$$\{{3\}}$$$ or $$$\{{2, 1, 3\}}$$$.
For the second test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $$$\{{3, 4\}}$$$ with value $$$7$$$.
For the third test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $$$\{{1\}}$$$ with value $$$1$$$.
For the fourth test case, Ashish can pick the subsequence $$$\{{7, 7\}}$$$ with value $$$7$$$.
