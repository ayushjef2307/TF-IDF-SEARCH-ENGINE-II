inputstandard input
outputstandard output
You are given two strings
s
and
t
, each of length
n
and consisting of lowercase Latin alphabets. You want to make
s
equal to
t
.
You can perform the following operation on
s
any number of times to achieve it —
Choose any substring of
s
and rotate it clockwise once, that is, if the selected substring is
s[l,l+1...r]
, then it becomes
s[r,l,l+1...r−1]
. All the remaining characters of
s
stay in their position.
For example, on rotating the substring
[2,4]
, string "abcde" becomes "adbce".
A string
a
is a substring of a string
b
if
a
can be obtained from
b
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
Find the minimum number of operations required to convert
s
to
t
, or determine that it's impossible.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤2000)
 — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(1≤n≤2000)
 — the length of the strings.
The second and the third lines contain strings
s
and
t
respectively.
The sum of
n
over all the test cases does not exceed
2000
.
Output
For each test case, output the minimum number of operations to convert
s
to
t
. If it is not possible to convert
s
to
t
, output
−1
instead.

Note
For the
1
-st test case, since
s
and
t
are equal, you don't need to apply any operation.
For the
2
-nd test case, you only need to apply one operation on the entire string ab to convert it to ba.
For the
3
-rd test case, you only need to apply one operation on the entire string abc to convert it to cab.
For the
4
-th test case, you need to apply the operation twice: first on the entire string abc to convert it to cab and then on the substring of length
2
beginning at the second character to convert it to cba.
For the
5
-th test case, you only need to apply one operation on the entire string abab to convert it to baba.
For the
6
-th test case, it is not possible to convert string
s
to
t
.
