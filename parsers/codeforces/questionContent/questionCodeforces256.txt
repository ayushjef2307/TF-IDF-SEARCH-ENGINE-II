The sum of digits of a non-negative integer
a
is the result of summing up its digits together when written in the decimal system. For example, the sum of digits of
123
is
6
and the sum of digits of
10
is
1
. In a formal way, the sum of digits of
a=
∑
i=0
∞
a
i
⋅
10
i
, where
0≤
a
i
≤9
, is defined as
∑
i=0
∞
a
i
.
Given an integer
n
, find two non-negative integers
x
and
y
which satisfy the following conditions.
x+y=n
, and
the sum of digits of
x
and the sum of digits of
y
differ by at most
1
.
It can be shown that such
x
and
y
always exist.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤10000
).
Each test case consists of a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
9
)
Output
For each test case, print two integers
x
and
y
.
If there are multiple answers, print any.

Note
In the second test case, the sum of digits of
67
and the sum of digits of
94
are both
13

In the third test case, the sum of digits of
60
is
6

7
is
