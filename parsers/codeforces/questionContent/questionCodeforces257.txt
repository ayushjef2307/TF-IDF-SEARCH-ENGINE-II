You are given a sequence
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. Each element of
a
is
1
or
2
.
Find out if an integer
k
exists so that the following conditions are met.
1≤k≤n−1
, and
a
1
⋅
a
2
⋅…⋅
a
k
=
a
k+1
⋅
a
k+2
⋅…⋅
a
n
.
If there exist multiple
k
that satisfy the given condition, print the smallest.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤1000
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤2
).
Output
For each test case, if there is no such
k
, print
−1
.
Otherwise, print the smallest possible
k
.

For the first test case,
k=2

For the third test case,
k=1

satisfy the given condition, so the answer is
1
