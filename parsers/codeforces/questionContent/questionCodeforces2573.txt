You are given four positive integers
n
,
m
,
a
,
b
(
1≤b≤n≤50
;
1≤a≤m≤50
). Find any such rectangular matrix of size
n×m
that satisfies all of the following conditions:
each row of the matrix contains exactly
a
ones;
each column of the matrix contains exactly
b
ones;
all other elements are zeros.
If the desired matrix does not exist, indicate this.
For example, for
n=3
,
m=6
,
a=2
,
b=1
, there exists a matrix satisfying the conditions above:

Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case is described by four positive integers
n
,
m
,
a
,
b
(
1≤b≤n≤50
;
1≤a≤m≤50
), where
n
and
m
are the sizes of the matrix, and
a
and
b
are the number of ones for rows and columns, respectively.
Output
For each test case print:
"YES" (without quotes) and the required matrix (if there are several answers, print any) if it exists, or
"NO" (without quotes) if it does not exist.
To print the matrix
n×m
, print
n
rows, each of which consists of
m
numbers
0
or
1
describing a row of the matrix. Numbers must be printed without spaces.
