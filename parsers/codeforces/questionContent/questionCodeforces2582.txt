Alice and Bob are playing yet another card game. This time the rules are the following. There are
n
cards lying in a row in front of them. The
i
-th card has value
a
i
.
First, Alice chooses a non-empty consecutive segment of cards
[l;r]
(
l≤r
). After that Bob removes a single card
j
from that segment
(l≤j≤r)
. The score of the game is the total value of the remaining cards on the segment
(
a
l
+
a
l+1
+⋯+
a
j−1
+
a
j+1
+⋯+
a
r−1
+
a
r
)
. In particular, if Alice chooses a segment with just one element, then the score after Bob removes the only card is
0
.
Alice wants to make the score as big as possible. Bob takes such a card that the score is as small as possible.
What segment should Alice choose so that the score is maximum possible? Output the maximum score.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of cards.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−30≤
a
i
≤30
) — the values on the cards.
Output
Print a single integer — the final score of the game.

Note
In the first example Alice chooses a segment
[1;5]
— the entire row of cards. Bob removes card
3
with the value
10
from the segment. Thus, the final score is
5+(−2)+(−1)+4=6
.
In the second example Alice chooses a segment
[1;4]
, so that Bob removes either card
1
or
3
with the value
5
, making the answer
5+2+3=10
.
In the third example Alice can choose any of the segments of length
1
:
[1;1]
,
[2;2]
or
[3;3]
. Bob removes the only card, so the score is
0
. If Alice chooses some other segment then the answer will be less than
0
.
