Levian works as an accountant in a large company. Levian knows how much the company has earned in each of the
n
consecutive months — in the
i
-th month the company had income equal to
a
i
(positive income means profit, negative income means loss, zero income means no change). Because of the general self-isolation, the first
⌈
n
2
⌉
months income might have been completely unstable, but then everything stabilized and for the last
⌊
n
2
⌋
months the income was the same.
Levian decided to tell the directors
n−k+1
numbers — the total income of the company for each
k
consecutive months. In other words, for each
i
between
1
and
n−k+1
he will say the value
a
i
+
a
i+1
+…+
a
i+k−1
. For example, if
a=[−1,0,1,2,2]
and
k=3
he will say the numbers
0,3,5
.
Unfortunately, if at least one total income reported by Levian is not a profit (income
≤0
), the directors will get angry and fire the failed accountant.
Save Levian's career: find any such
k
, that for each
k
months in a row the company had made a profit, or report that it is impossible.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤5⋅
10
5
) — the number of months for which Levian must account.
The second line contains
⌈
n
2
⌉
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
⌈
n
2
⌉
, where
a
i
(
−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the income of the company in the
i
-th month.
Third line contains a single integer
x
(
−
10
9
≤x≤
10
9
) — income in every month from
⌈
n
2
⌉+1
to
n
.
Output
In a single line, print the appropriate integer
k
or
−1
, if it does not exist.
If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any.

Note
In the first example,
k=2
and
k=3
satisfy: in the first case, Levian will report the numbers
1,1
, and in the second case — one number
3
.
In the second example, there is no such
k
.
In the third example, the only answer is
k=4
: he will report the numbers
1,2,3
.
