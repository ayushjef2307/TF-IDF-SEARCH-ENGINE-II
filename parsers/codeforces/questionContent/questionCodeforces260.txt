An edge-weighted tree of
n
nodes is given with each edge colored in some color. Each node of this tree can be blocked or unblocked, all nodes are unblocked initially.
A simple path is a path in a graph that does not have repeating nodes. The length of a path is defined as the sum of weights of all edges on the path.
A path is good when it is a simple path consisting of edges of the same color
c
, all edges of color
c
are on this path, and every node on the path is unblocked.
You need to operate
2
kinds of queries:
block a node,
unblock a node.
After each query, print the maximum length among all good paths. If there are no good paths, print
0
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
,
q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of nodes and the number of queries.
Then
n−1
lines follow, each containing four integers
u
,
v
,
w
and
c
(
1≤u,v,w,c≤n
;
u≠v
), denoting a weighted edge connecting node
u
and node
v
with weight
w
and color
c
. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.
Then
q
lines follow, each containing two integers
p
and
x
(
p=0
or
p=1
,
1≤x≤n
), denoting a query:
if
p=0
, block the node
x
. It's guaranteed that it's not blocked at this time;
if
p=1
, unblock the node
x
. It's guaranteed that it's blocked at this time.
Output
For each query, print the maximum length of a good path. If there are no good paths, print
0
.
