Implement a quantum oracle on
N
qubits which checks whether the input bit string is a little-endian notation of a number that is divisible by 3.
Your operation should take the following inputs:
an array of
N≤8
qubits "inputs" in an arbitrary state.
a qubit "output" in an arbitrary state.
Your operation should perform a unitary transformation on those qubits that can be described by its effect on the basis states: if "inputs" is in the basis state
|x⟩
and "output" is in the basis state
|y⟩
, the result of applying the operation should be
|x⟩|y⊕f(x)⟩
, where
f(x)=1
if the integer represented by the bit string
x
is divisible by
3
, and
0
otherwise.
For example, if the qubits passed to your operation are in the state
1

√
(|110⟩+|001⟩
)
x
⊗|0
⟩
y
=

√
(|3⟩+|4⟩
)
x
⊗|0

y
, the state of the system after applying the operation should be

(|3

√
(|110

⊗|1

y
+|001

y
)
.
Your code should have the following signature (note that your operation should have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined for it; is Adj+Ctl in the operation signature will generate them automatically based on your code):
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;

    operation Solve (inputs : Qubit[], output : Qubit) : Unit is Adj+Ctl {
        // your code here
    }
}
Your code is not allowed to use measurements or arbitrary rotation gates. This operation can be implemented using just the X gate and its controlled variants (possibly with multiple qubits as controls).
