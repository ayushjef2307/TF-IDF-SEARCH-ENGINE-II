You are given two qubits in state
|00⟩
. Your task is to prepare the following state on them:
1
3
–
√
(|01⟩+|10⟩+|11⟩)
1
This task is very similar to problem A1 of the Winter 2019 contest, but this time you are not allowed to use any gates except the Pauli gates (X, Y and Z), the Hadamard gate and the controlled versions of those. However, you are allowed to use measurements.
You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 2 qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;

    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Unit {
        // your code here
    }
}
