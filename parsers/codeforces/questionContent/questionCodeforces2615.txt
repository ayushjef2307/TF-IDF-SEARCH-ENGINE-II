You are given an operation that implements a single-qubit unitary transformation: either the Z gate or the -Z gate (i.e., the
−|0⟩⟨0|+|1⟩⟨1|
gate:
(−Z)(α|0⟩+β|1⟩)=−α|0⟩+β|1⟩
). The operation will have Adjoint and Controlled variants defined.
Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which unitary it was and to return 0 if it was the Z gate or 1 if it was the -Z gate.
You are allowed to apply the given operation and its adjoint/controlled variants exactly once.
You have to implement an operation which takes a single-qubit operation as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;

    operation Solve (unitary : (Qubit => Unit is Adj+Ctl)) : Int {
        // your code here
    }
}
