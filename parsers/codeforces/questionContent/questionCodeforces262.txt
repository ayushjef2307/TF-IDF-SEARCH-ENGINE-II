You are given an array of exactly
n
numbers
[1,2,3,…,n]
along with integers
k
and
x
.
Partition the array in exactly
k
non-empty disjoint subsequences such that the bitwise XOR of all numbers in each subsequence is
x
, and each number is in exactly one subsequence. Notice that there are no constraints on the length of each subsequence.
A sequence
a
is a subsequence of a sequence
b
if
a
can be obtained from
b
by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
For example, for
n=15
,
k=6
,
x=7
, the following scheme is valid:
[6,10,11]
,
6⊕10⊕11=7
,
[5,12,14]
,
5⊕12⊕14=7
,
[3,9,13]
,
3⊕9⊕13=7
,
[1,2,4]
,
1⊕2⊕4=7
,
[8,15]
,
8⊕15=7
,
[7]
,
7=7
,
where
⊕
represents the bitwise XOR operation.
The following scheme is invalid, since
8
,
15
do not appear:
[6,10,11]
,
6⊕10⊕11=7
,
[5,12,14]
,
5⊕12⊕14=7
,
[3,9,13]
,
3⊕9⊕13=7
,
[1,2,4]
,
1⊕2⊕4=7
,
[7]
,
7=7
.
The following scheme is invalid, since
3
appears twice, and
1
,
2
do not appear:
[6,10,11]
,
6⊕10⊕11=7
,
[5,12,14]
,
5⊕12⊕14=7
,
[3,9,13]
,
3⊕9⊕13=7
,
[3,4]
,
3⊕4=7
,
[8,15]
,
8⊕15=7
,
[7]
,
7=7
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first and the only line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
k
,
x
(
1≤k≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;
1≤x≤
10
9
) — the length of the array, the number of subsequences and the required XOR.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, if it is possible to partition the sequence, print "YES" in the first line. In the
i
-th of the following
k
lines first print the length
s
i
of the
i
-th subsequence, then print
s
i
integers, representing the elements in the
i
-th subsequence. If there are multiple answers, print any. Note that you can print a subsequence in any order.
If it is not possible to partition the sequence, print "NO".

Note
In the first test case, we construct the following
6
subsequences:
[6,10,11]
,
6⊕10⊕11=7
,
[5,12,14]
,
5⊕12⊕14=7
,
[3,9,13]
,
3⊕9⊕13=7
,
[1,2,4]
,
1⊕2⊕4=7
,
[8,15]
,
8⊕15=7
,
[7]
,
7=7
.
In the second test case, we construct the following
4
subsequences:
[1,4]
,
1⊕4=5
,
[2,7]
,
2⊕7=5
,
[3,6]
,
3⊕6=5
,
[5,8,9,10,11]
,
5⊕8⊕9⊕10⊕11=5
.
The following solution is considered correct in this test case as well:
[1,4]
,
1⊕4=5
,
[2,7]
,
2⊕7=5
,
[5]
,
5=5
,
[3,6,8,9,10,11]
,
