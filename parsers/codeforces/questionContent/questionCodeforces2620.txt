This is an interactive problem.
We have hidden an integer
1≤X≤
10
9
. You don't have to guess this number. You have to find the number of divisors of this number, and you don't even have to find the exact number: your answer will be considered correct if its absolute error is not greater than 7 or its relative error is not greater than
0.5
. More formally, let your answer be
ans
and the number of divisors of
X
be
d
, then your answer will be considered correct if at least one of the two following conditions is true:
|ans−d|≤7
;
1
2
≤
ans
d
≤2
.
You can make at most
22
queries. One query consists of one integer
1≤Q≤
10
18
. In response, you will get
gcd(X,Q)
 — the greatest common divisor of
X
and
Q
.
The number
X
is fixed before all queries. In other words, interactor is not adaptive.
Let's call the process of guessing the number of divisors of number
X
a game. In one test you will have to play
T
independent games, that is, guess the number of divisors
T
times for
T
independent values of
X
.
Input
The first line of input contains one integer
T
(
1≤T≤100
) — the number of games.
Interaction
To make a query print a line "? Q" (
1≤Q≤
10
18
). After that read one integer
gcd(X,Q)
. You can make no more than
22
such queries during one game.
If you are confident that you have figured out the number of divisors of
X
with enough precision, you can print your answer in "! ans" format.
ans
have to be an integer. If this was the last game, you have to terminate the program, otherwise you have to start the next game immediately. Note that the interactor doesn't print anything in response to you printing answer.
After printing a query do not forget to output end of line and flush the output. To do this, use:
fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
flush(output) in Pascal;
stdout.flush() in Python;
see documentation for other languages.
Hacks
To hack, use the following format:
The first line contains one integer
T
(
1≤T≤100
) — the number of games.
Each of the next
T
lines contains one integer
X
(
1≤X≤
10
9
) — the hidden number.
So the example has the form

998244353
4194304

Note
Why the limitation for number of queries is 22 exactly? Maybe the problem author is a Taylor Swift fan.
Let's look at the example.
In the first game
X=998244353
is hidden. Would be hard to guess this, right? This number is prime, so the number of its divisors is 2. The solution has made several random queries, and all the responses turned out to be 1 (strange things, not even one of three random numbers is divisible by
998244353
). It's fare to assume that the hidden number doesn't have many divisors, so the solution has answered 5. Why not. This answer will be considered correct since
|5−2|=3≤7
.
In the second game
X=4194304=
2
22
is hidden, it has 23 divisors. The solution has made queries
1024=
2
10
,
1048576=
2
20
,
1073741824=

and got responses
1024=
2
10
,
1048576=
2
20
,
4194304=
2
22
, respectively. Then the solution got completely confused and answered the answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. This answer will be considered correct since
