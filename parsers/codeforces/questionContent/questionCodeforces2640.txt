A permutation of length
n
is an array
p=[
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
]
, which contains every integer from
1
to
n
(inclusive) and, moreover, each number appears exactly once. For example,
p=[3,1,4,2,5]
is a permutation of length
5
.
For a given number
n
(
n≥2
), find a permutation
p
in which absolute difference (that is, the absolute value of difference) of any two neighboring (adjacent) elements is between
2
and
4
, inclusive. Formally, find such permutation
p
that
2≤|
p
i
−
p
i+1
|≤4
for each
i
(
1≤i<n
).
Print any such permutation for the given integer
n
or determine that it does not exist.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases in the input. Then
t
test cases follow.
Each test case is described by a single line containing an integer
n
(
2≤n≤1000
).
Output
Print
t
lines. Print a permutation that meets the given requirements. If there are several such permutations, then print any of them. If no such permutation exists, print -1.
