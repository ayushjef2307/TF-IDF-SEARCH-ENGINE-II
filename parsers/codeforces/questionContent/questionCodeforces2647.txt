Skier rides on a snowy field. Its movements can be described by a string of characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E' (which correspond to
1
meter movement in the south, north, west or east direction respectively).
It is known that if he moves along a previously unvisited segment of a path (i.e. this segment of the path is visited the first time), then the time of such movement is
5
seconds. If he rolls along previously visited segment of a path (i.e., this segment of the path has been covered by his path before), then it takes
1
second.
Find the skier's time to roll all the path.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases in the input. Then
t
test cases follow.
Each set is given by one nonempty string of the characters 'S', 'N', 'W', 'E'. The length of the string does not exceed
10
5
characters.
The sum of the lengths of
t
given lines over all test cases in the input does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print the desired path time in seconds.
