Phoenix is trying to take a photo of his
n
friends with labels
1,2,…,n
who are lined up in a row in a special order. But before he can take the photo, his friends get distracted by a duck and mess up their order.
Now, Phoenix must restore the order but he doesn't remember completely! He only remembers that the
i
-th friend from the left had a label between
a
i
and
b
i
inclusive. Does there exist a unique way to order his friends based of his memory?
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
)  — the number of friends.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contain two integers
a
i
and
b
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤
b
i
≤n
)  — Phoenix's memory of the
i
-th position from the left.
It is guaranteed that Phoenix's memory is valid so there is at least one valid ordering.
Output
If Phoenix can reorder his friends in a unique order, print YES followed by
n
integers  — the
i
-th integer should be the label of the
i
-th friend from the left.
Otherwise, print NO. Then, print any two distinct valid orderings on the following two lines. If are multiple solutions, print any.
