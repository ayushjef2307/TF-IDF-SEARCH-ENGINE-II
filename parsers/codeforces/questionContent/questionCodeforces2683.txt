You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers (it is guaranteed that
n
is even, i.e. divisible by
2
). All
a
i
does not exceed some integer
k
.
Your task is to replace the minimum number of elements (replacement is the following operation: choose some index
i
from
1
to
n
and replace
a
i
with some integer in range
[1;k]
) to satisfy the following conditions:
after all replacements, all
a
i
are positive integers not greater than
k
;
for all
i
from
1
to
n
2
the following equation is true:
a
i
+
a
n−i+1
=x
, where
x
should be the same for all
n
2
pairs of elements.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,1≤k≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of
a
and the maximum possible value of some
a
i
correspondingly. It is guratanteed that
n
is even (i.e. divisible by
2
). The second line of the test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤k
), where
a
i
is the
i
-th element of
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
(as well as the sum of
k
) over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
(
∑n≤2⋅
10
5
,
∑k≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
For each test case, print the answer — the minimum number of elements you have to replace in
a
to satisfy the conditions from the problem statement.
