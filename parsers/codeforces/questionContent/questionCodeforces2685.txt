You are given a positive integer
n
, it is guaranteed that
n
is even (i.e. divisible by
2
).
You want to construct the array
a
of length
n
such that:
The first
n
2
elements of
a
are even (divisible by
2
);
the second
n
2
elements of
a
are odd (not divisible by
2
);
all elements of
a
are distinct and positive;
the sum of the first half equals to the sum of the second half (
∑
i=1
n
2
a
i
=
∑
i=
n

+1
n
a

).
If there are multiple answers, you can print any. It is not guaranteed that the answer exists.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The only line of the test case contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array. It is guaranteed that that
n
is even (i.e. divisible by
2
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
(
∑n≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
For each test case, print the answer — "NO" (without quotes), if there is no suitable answer for the given test case or "YES" in the first line and any suitable array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
