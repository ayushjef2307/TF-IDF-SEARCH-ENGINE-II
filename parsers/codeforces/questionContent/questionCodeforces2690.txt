You are given two integers
a
and
b
, and
q
queries. The
i
-th query consists of two numbers
l
i
and
r
i
, and the answer to it is the number of integers
x
such that
l
i
≤x≤
r
i
, and
((xmoda)modb)≠((xmodb)moda)
. Calculate the answer for each query.
Recall that
ymodz
is the remainder of the division of
y
by
z
. For example,
5mod3=2
,
7mod8=7
,
9mod4=1
,
9mod9=0
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
a
,
b
and
q
(
1≤a,b≤200
;
1≤q≤500
).
Then
q
lines follow, each containing two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤
10
18
) for the corresponding query.
Output
For each test case, print
q
integers — the answers to the queries of this test case in the order they appear.
