Let's say string
s
has period
k
if
s
i
=
s
i+k
for all
i
from
1
to
|s|−k
(
|s|
means length of string
s
) and
k
is the minimum positive integer with this property.
Some examples of a period: for
s
="0101" the period is
k=2
, for
s
="0000" the period is
k=1
, for
s
="010" the period is
k=2
, for
s
="0011" the period is
k=4
.
You are given string
t
consisting only of 0's and 1's and you need to find such string
s
that:
String
s
consists only of 0's and 1's;
The length of
s
doesn't exceed
2⋅|t|
;
String
t
is a subsequence of string
s
;
String
s
has smallest possible period among all strings that meet conditions 1—3.
Let us recall that
t
is a subsequence of
s
if
t
can be derived from
s
by deleting zero or more elements (any) without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example,
t
="011" is a subsequence of
s
="10101".
Input
The first line contains single integer
T
(
1≤T≤100
) — the number of test cases.
Next
T
lines contain test cases — one per line. Each line contains string
t
(
1≤|t|≤100
) consisting only of 0's and 1's.
Output
Print one string for each test case — string
s
you needed to find. If there are multiple solutions print any one of them.

Note
In the first and second test cases,
s=t
since it's already one of the optimal solutions. Answers have periods equal to
1
and
2
, respectively.
In the third test case, there are shorter optimal solutions, but it's okay since we don't need to minimize the string
s
. String
s
has period equal to
1
.
