You have array of
n
numbers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
.
Rearrange these numbers to satisfy

, where
|x|
denotes absolute value of
x
. It's always possible to find such rearrangement.
Note that all numbers in
a
are not necessarily different. In other words, some numbers of
a
may be same.
You have to answer independent
t
test cases.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains single integer
n
(
3≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of array
a
. It is guaranteed that the sum of values of
n
over all test cases in the input does not exceed
10

.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers

Output
For each test case, print the rearranged version of array
a
which satisfies given condition. If there are multiple valid rearrangements, print any of them.
