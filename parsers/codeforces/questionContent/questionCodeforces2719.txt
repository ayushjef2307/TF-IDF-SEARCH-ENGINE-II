The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.
You are given a sequence
a
consisting of
n
positive integers.
Let's define a three blocks palindrome as the sequence, consisting of at most two distinct elements (let these elements are
a
and
b
,
a
can be equal
b
) and is as follows:
[
a,a,…,a

. There
x,y
are integers greater than or equal to
0
. For example, sequences
[]
,
[2]
,
[1,1]
,
[1,2,1]
,
[1,2,2,1]
and
[1,1,2,1,1]
are three block palindromes but
[1,2,3,2,1]
,
[1,2,1,2,1]
and
[1,2]
are not.
Your task is to choose the maximum by length subsequence of
a
that is a three blocks palindrome.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Recall that the sequence
t
is a a subsequence of the sequence
s
if
t
can be derived from
s
by removing zero or more elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, if
s=[1,2,1,3,1,2,1]
, then possible subsequences are:
[1,1,1,1]
,
[3]
and
[1,2,1,3,1,2,1]
, but not
[3,2,3]
and
[1,1,1,1,2]
.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2000
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of the test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2000
) — the length of
a
. The second line of the test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤26
), where
a
i
is the
i
-th element of
a
. Note that the maximum value of
a
i
can be up to
26
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2000
(
∑n≤2000
).
Output
For each test case, print the answer — the maximum possible length of some subsequence of
a
that is a three blocks palindrome.
