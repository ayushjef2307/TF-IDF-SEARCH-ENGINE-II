Let's denote the following function
f
. This function takes an array
a
of length
n
and returns an array. Initially the result is an empty array. For each integer
i
from
1
to
n
we add element
a
i
to the end of the resulting array if it is greater than all previous elements (more formally, if
a
i
>
max
1≤j<i
a
j
). Some examples of the function
f
:
if
a=[3,1,2,7,7,3,6,7,8]
then
f(a)=[3,7,8]
;
if
a=[1]
then
f(a)=[1]
;
if
a=[4,1,1,2,3]
then
f(a)=[4]
;
if
a=[1,3,1,2,6,8,7,7,4,11,10]
then
f(a)=[1,3,6,8,11]
.
You are given two arrays: array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and array
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
m
. You can delete some elements of array
a
(possibly zero). To delete the element
a
i
, you have to pay
p
i
coins (the value of
p
i
can be negative, then you get
|
p
i
|
coins, if you delete this element). Calculate the minimum number of coins (possibly negative) you have to spend for fulfilling equality
f(a)=b
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
)
— the length of array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(1≤
a
i
≤n)
— the array
a
.
The third line contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,

10
9
)
— the array
p
.
The fourth line contains one integer
m
(1≤m≤n)
— the length of array
b
.
The fifth line contains
m
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
m
(1≤
b
i
≤n,
b
i−1
<
b
i
)
— the array
b
.
Output
If the answer exists, in the first line print YES. In the second line, print the minimum number of coins you have to spend for fulfilling equality
f(a)=b
.
Otherwise in only line print NO.
