You are given a positive integer
D
. Let's build the following graph from it:
each vertex is a divisor of
D
(not necessarily prime,
1
and
D
itself are also included);
two vertices
x
and
y
(
x>y
) have an undirected edge between them if
x
is divisible by
y
and
x
y
is a prime;
the weight of an edge is the number of divisors of
x
that are not divisors of
y
.
For example, here is the graph for
D=12
:
Edge
(4,12)
has weight
3
because
12
has divisors
[1,2,3,4,6,12]
and
4
has divisors
[1,2,4]
. Thus, there are
3
divisors of
12
that are not divisors of
4
—
[3,6,12]
.
There is no edge between
3
and
2
because
3
is not divisible by
2
. There is no edge between
12
and
3
because
12
3
=4
is not a prime.
Let the length of the path between some vertices
v
and
u
in the graph be the total weight of edges on it. For example, path
[(1,2),(2,6),(6,12),(12,4),(4,2),(2,6)]
has length
1+2+2+3+1+2=11
. The empty path has length
0
.
So the shortest path between two vertices
v
and
u
is the path that has the minimal possible length.
Two paths
a
and
b
are different if there is either a different number of edges in them or there is a position
i
such that
a
i
and
b
i
are different edges.
You are given
q
queries of the following form:
v
u
— calculate the number of the shortest paths between vertices
v
and
u
.
The answer for each query might be large so print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
D
(
1≤D≤
10
15
) — the number the graph is built from.
The second line contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤3⋅
10
5
) — the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
v
and
u
(
1≤v,u≤D
). It is guaranteed that
D
is divisible by both
v
and
u
(both
v
and
u
are divisors of
D
).
Output
Print
q
integers — for each query output the number of the shortest paths between the two given vertices modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first example:
The first query is only the empty path — length
0
;
The second query are paths
[(12,4),(4,2),(2,1)]
(length
3+1+1=5
),
[(12,6),(6,2),(2,1)]
(length
2+2+1=5
) and
[(12,6),(6,3),(3,1)]
(length
2+2+1=5
).
The third query is only the path
[(3,1),(1,2),(2,4)]
(length
1+1+1=3
).
