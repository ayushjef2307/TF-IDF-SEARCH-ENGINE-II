This is the easy version of the problem. In this version, you only need to find the answer once. In this version, hacks are not allowed.
In a computer game, you are fighting against
n
monsters. Monster number
i
has
a
i
health points, all
a
i
are integers. A monster is alive while it has at least
1
health point.
You can cast spells of two types:
Deal
1
damage to any single alive monster of your choice.
Deal
1
damage to all alive monsters. If at least one monster dies (ends up with
0
health points) as a result of this action, then repeat it (and keep repeating while at least one monster dies every time).
Dealing
1
damage to a monster reduces its health by
1
.
Spells of type 1 can be cast any number of times, while a spell of type 2 can be cast at most once during the game.
What is the smallest number of times you need to cast spells of type 1 to kill all monsters?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). The description of the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer
n
 (
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of monsters.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
 (
1≤
a
i
≤n
) — monsters' health points.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the smallest number of times you need to cast spells of type 1 to kill all monsters.

Note
In the first test case, the initial health points of the monsters are
[3,1,2]
. It is enough to cast a spell of type 2:
Monsters' health points change to
[2,0,1]
. Since monster number
2
dies, the spell is repeated.
Monsters' health points change to
[1,0,0]
. Since monster number
3
dies, the spell is repeated.
Monsters' health points change to
[0,0,0]
. Since monster number
1
dies, the spell is repeated.
Monsters' health points change to
[0,0,0]
.
Since it is possible to use no spells of type 1 at all, the answer is
0
.
In the second test case, the initial health points of the monsters are
[4,1,5,4,1,1]
. Here is one of the optimal action sequences:
Using a spell of type 1, deal
1
damage to monster number
1
. Monsters' health points change to
[3,1,5,4,1,1]
.
Using a spell of type 1, deal
1
damage to monster number
4
. Monsters' health points change to
[3,1,5,3,1,1]
.
Using a spell of type 1, deal
1
damage to monster number
4
again. Monsters' health points change to
[3,1,5,2,1,1]
.
Use a spell of type 2:
Monsters' health points change to
[2,0,4,1,0,0]
. Since monsters number
2
,
5
, and
6
die, the spell is repeated.
Monsters' health points change to
[1,0,3,0,0,0]
. Since monster number
4
dies, the spell is repeated.
Monsters' health points change to
[0,0,2,0,0,0]
. Since monster number
1
dies, the spell is repeated.
Monsters' health points change to
[0,0,1,0,0,0]
.
Using a spell of type 1, deal
1
damage to monster number
3
. Monsters' health points change to
[0,0,0,0,0,0]
.
Spells of type 1 are cast
4
times in total. It can be shown that this is the smallest possible number.
