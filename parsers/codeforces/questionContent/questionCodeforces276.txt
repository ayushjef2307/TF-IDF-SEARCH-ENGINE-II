You are given a tree of
n
vertices and
n−1
edges. The
i
-th vertex has an initial weight
a
i
.
Let the distance
d
v
(u)
from vertex
v
to vertex
u
be the number of edges on the path from
v
to
u
. Note that
d
v
(u)=
d
u
(v)
and
d
v
(v)=0
.
Let the weighted distance
w
v
(u)
from
v
to
u
be
w
v
(u)=
d
v
(u)+
a
u
. Note that
w
v
(v)=
a
v
and
w
v
(u)≠
w
u
(v)
if
a
u
≠
a
v
.
Analogically to usual distance, let's define the eccentricity
e(v)
of vertex
v
as the greatest weighted distance from
v
to any other vertex (including
v
itself), or
e(v)=
max
1≤u≤n
w
v
(u)
.
Finally, let's define the radius
r
of the tree as the minimum eccentricity of any vertex, or
r=
min
1≤v≤n
e(v)
.
You need to perform
m
queries of the following form:
v
j
x
j
 — assign
a
v
j
=
x
j
.
After performing each query, print the radius
r
of the current tree.
Input
The first line contains the single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
6
) — the initial weights of vertices.
Next
n−1
lines contain edges of tree. The
i
-th line contains two integers
u
i
and
v
i
(
1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n
;
u
i
≠
v
i
) — the corresponding edge. The given edges form a tree.
The next line contains the single integer
m
(
1≤m≤
10
5
) — the number of queries.
Next
m
lines contain queries — one query per line. The
j
-th query contains two integers
v
j
and
x
j
(
1≤
v
j
≤n
;
0≤
x
j
≤
10
6
) — a vertex and it's new weight.
Output
Print
m
integers — the radius
r
of the tree after performing each query.

Note
After the first query, you have the following tree:
The marked vertex in the picture is the vertex with minimum
e(v)
, or
r=e(4)=7
. The eccentricities of the other vertices are the following:
e(1)=8
,
e(2)=9
,
e(3)=9
,
e(5)=8
,
e(6)=8
.
The tree after the second query:
The radius
r=e(1)=4
.
After the third query, the radius
r=e(2)=5
