and
m

Calculate the number of distinct arrays
a
, consisting of
n
integers such that:
0≤
a
i
<
2
k
for each
1≤i≤n
;
bitwise AND of numbers
a[

]&a[
l
i
+1]&…&a[
r
i
]=

i
for each
1≤i≤m
.
Two arrays
a
and
b
are considered different if there exists such a position
i
that
a
i
≠
b
i
.
The number can be pretty large so print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
k
and
m
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
,
1≤k≤30
,
0≤m≤5⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array
a
, the value such that all numbers in
a
should be smaller than
2
k
and the number of conditions, respectively.
Each of the next
m
lines contains the description of a condition
l
i
,
r
i
and
x
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
,
0≤
x
i
<
2
k
) — the borders of the condition segment and the required bitwise AND value on it.
Output
Print a single integer — the number of distinct arrays
a
that satisfy all the above conditions modulo
998244353
.

Note
You can recall what is a bitwise AND operation here.
In the first example, the answer is the following arrays:
[3,3,7,6]
,
[3,7,7,6]
and
[7,3,7,6]
.
