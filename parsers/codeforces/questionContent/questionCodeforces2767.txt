You wrote down all integers from
0
to
10
n
−1
, padding them with leading zeroes so their lengths are exactly
n
. For example, if
n=3
then you wrote out 000, 001, ..., 998, 999.
A block in an integer
x
is a consecutive segment of equal digits that cannot be extended to the left or to the right.
For example, in the integer
00027734000
there are three blocks of length
1
, one block of length
2
and two blocks of length
3
.
For all integers
i
from
1
to
n
count the number of blocks of length
i
among the written down integers.
Since these integers may be too large, print them modulo
998244353
.
Input
The only line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
In the only line print
n
integers. The
i
-th integer is equal to the number of blocks of length
i
.
Since these integers may be too large, print them modulo
998244353
.
