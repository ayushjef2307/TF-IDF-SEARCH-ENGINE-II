You are given a integer
n
(
n>0
). Find any integer
s
which satisfies these conditions, or report that there are no such numbers:
In the decimal representation of
s
:
s>0
,
s
consists of
n
digits,
no digit in
s
equals
0
,
s
is not divisible by any of it's digits.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤400
), the number of test cases. The next
t
lines each describe a test case.
Each test case contains one positive integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
for all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print an integer
s
which satisfies the conditions described above, or "-1" (without quotes), if no such number exists. If there are multiple possible solutions for
s
, print any solution.

Note
In the first test case, there are no possible solutions for
s
consisting of one digit, because any such solution is divisible by itself.
For the second test case, the possible solutions are:
23
,
27
,
29
,
34
,
37
,
38
,

.
For the third test case, one possible solution is
239
because
239
is not divisible by
2
,
3
or
9
and has three digits (none of which equals zero).
