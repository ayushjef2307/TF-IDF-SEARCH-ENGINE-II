It's the year 5555. You have a graph, and you want to find a long cycle and a huge independent set, just because you can. But for now, let's just stick with finding either.
Given a connected graph with
n
vertices, you can choose to either:
find an independent set that has exactly
⌈
n
−
−
√
⌉
vertices.
find a simple cycle of length at least
⌈
n
−
−
√
⌉
.
An independent set is a set of vertices such that no two of them are connected by an edge. A simple cycle is a cycle that doesn't contain any vertex twice. I have a proof you can always solve one of these problems, but it's too long to fit this margin.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
5≤n≤
10
5
,
n−1≤m≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
Each of the next
m
lines contains two space-separated integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
) that mean there's an edge between vertices
u
and
v
. It's guaranteed that the graph is connected and doesn't contain any self-loops or multiple edges.
Output
If you choose to solve the first problem, then on the first line print "1", followed by a line containing
⌈
n
−
−
√
⌉
distinct integers not exceeding
n
, the vertices in the desired independent set.
If you, however, choose to solve the second problem, then on the first line print "2", followed by a line containing one integer,
c
, representing the length of the found cycle, followed by a line containing
c
distinct integers integers not exceeding
n
, the vertices in the desired cycle, in the order they appear in the cycle.

Note
In the first sample:
Notice that you can solve either problem, so printing the cycle
2−4−3−1−5−6
is also acceptable.
In the second sample:
Notice that if there are multiple answers you can print any, so printing the cycle
2−5−6
, for example, is acceptable.
In the third sample:
