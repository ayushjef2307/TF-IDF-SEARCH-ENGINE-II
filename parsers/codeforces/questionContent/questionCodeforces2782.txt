You are given an array
a
of length
n
that has a special condition: every element in this array has at most 7 divisors. Find the length of the shortest non-empty subsequence of this array product of whose elements is a perfect square.
A sequence
a
is a subsequence of an array
b
if
a
can be obtained from
b
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers

a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤

) — the elements of the array
a
.
Output
Output the length of the shortest non-empty subsequence of
a
product of whose elements is a perfect square. If there are several shortest subsequences, you can find any of them. If there's no such subsequence, print "-1".

Note
In the first sample, you can choose a subsequence
[1]
.
In the second sample, you can choose a subsequence
[6,6]
.
In the third sample, you can choose a subsequence
[6,15,10]
.
In the fourth sample, there is no such subsequence.
