Given 2 integers
u
and
v
, find the shortest array such that bitwise-xor of its elements is
u
, and the sum of its elements is
v
.
Input
The only line contains 2 integers
u
and
v
(0≤u,v≤
10
18
)
.
Output
If there's no array that satisfies the condition, print "-1". Otherwise:
The first line should contain one integer,
n
, representing the length of the desired array. The next line should contain
n
positive integers, the array itself. If there are multiple possible answers, print any.

Note
In the first sample,
3⊕1=2
and
3+1=4
. There is no valid array of smaller length.
Notice that in the fourth sample the array is empty.
