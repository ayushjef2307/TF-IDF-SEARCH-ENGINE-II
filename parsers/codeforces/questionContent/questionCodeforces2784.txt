You are given a tree consisting of
n
nodes. You want to write some labels on the tree's edges such that the following conditions hold:
Every label is an integer between
0
and
n−2
inclusive.
All the written labels are distinct.
The largest value among
MEX(u,v)
over all pairs of nodes
(u,v)
is as small as possible.
Here,
MEX(u,v)
denotes the smallest non-negative integer that isn't written on any edge on the unique simple path from node
u
to node
v
.
Input
The first line contains the integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of nodes in the tree.
Each of the next
n−1
lines contains two space-separated integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
) that mean there's an edge between nodes
u
and
v
. It's guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.
Output
Output
n−1
integers. The
i
th
of them will be the number written on the
i
th
edge (in the input order).
