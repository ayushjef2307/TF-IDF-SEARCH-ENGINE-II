You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers.
You have to perform the sequence of
n−2
operations on this array:
during the first operation, you either add
a
2
to
a
1
and subtract
a
2
from
a
3
, or add
a
2
to
a
3
and subtract
a
2
from
a
1
;
during the second operation, you either add
a
3
to
a
2
and subtract
a
3
from
a
4
, or add
a
3
to
a
4
and subtract
a
3
from
a
2
;
...
during the last operation, you either add
a
n−1
to
a
n−2
and subtract
a
n−1
from
a
n
, or add
a
n−1
to
a
n
and subtract
a
n−1
from
a
n−2
.
So, during the
i
-th operation, you add the value of
a
i+1
to one of its neighbors, and subtract it from the other neighbor.
For example, if you have the array
[1,2,3,4,5]
, one of the possible sequences of operations is:
subtract
2
from
a
3
and add it to
a
1
, so the array becomes
[3,2,1,4,5]
;
subtract
1
from
a
2
and add it to
a
4
, so the array becomes
[3,1,1,5,5]
;
subtract
5
from
a
3
and add it to
a
5
, so the array becomes
[3,1,−4,5,10]
.
So, the resulting array is
[3,1,−4,5,10]
.
An array is reachable if it can be obtained by performing the aforementioned sequence of operations on
a
. You have to calculate the number of reachable arrays, and print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤300
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤300
).
Output
Print one integer — the number of reachable arrays. Since the answer can be very large, print its remainder modulo
998244353
.
