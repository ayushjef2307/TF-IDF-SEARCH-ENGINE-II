There is a frog staying to the left of the string
s=
s
1
s
2
…
s
n
consisting of
n
characters (to be more precise, the frog initially stays at the cell
0
). Each character of
s
is either 'L' or 'R'. It means that if the frog is staying at the
i
-th cell and the
i
-th character is 'L', the frog can jump only to the left. If the frog is staying at the
i
-th cell and the
i
-th character is 'R', the frog can jump only to the right. The frog can jump only to the right from the cell
0
.
Note that the frog can jump into the same cell twice and can perform as many jumps as it needs.
The frog wants to reach the
n+1
-th cell. The frog chooses some positive integer value
d
before the first jump (and cannot change it later) and jumps by no more than
d
cells at once. I.e. if the
i
-th character is 'L' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range
[max(0,i−d);i−1]
, and if the
i
-th character is 'R' then the frog can jump to any cell in a range
[i+1;min(n+1;i+d)]
.
The frog doesn't want to jump far, so your task is to find the minimum possible value of
d
such that the frog can reach the cell
n+1
from the cell
0
if it can jump by no more than
d
cells at once. It is guaranteed that it is always possible to reach
n+1
from
0
.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The next
t
lines describe test cases. The
i
-th test case is described as a string
s
consisting of at least
1
and at most
2⋅
10
5
characters 'L' and 'R'.
It is guaranteed that the sum of lengths of strings over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
(
∑|s|≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
For each test case, print the answer — the minimum possible value of
d
such that the frog can reach the cell
n+1
from the cell
0
if it jumps by no more than
d
at once.

Note
The picture describing the first test case of the example and one of the possible answers:
In the second test case of the example, the frog can only jump directly from
0
to
n+1
.
In the third test case of the example, the frog can choose
d=3
, jump to the cell
3
from the cell
0
and then to the cell
4
from the cell
3
.
In the fourth test case of the example, the frog can choose
d=1
and jump
5
times to the right.
In the fifth test case of the example, the frog can only jump directly from
0
to
n+1
.
In the sixth test case of the example, the frog can choose
d=1
and jump
2
times to the right.
