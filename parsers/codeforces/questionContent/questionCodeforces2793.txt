You are given an array
a
of length
n
and array
b
of length
m
both consisting of only integers
0
and
1
. Consider a matrix
c
of size
n×m
formed by following rule:
c
i,j
=
a
i
⋅
b
j
(i.e.
a
i
multiplied by
b
j
). It's easy to see that
c
consists of only zeroes and ones too.
How many subrectangles of size (area)
k
consisting only of ones are there in
c
?
A subrectangle is an intersection of a consecutive (subsequent) segment of rows and a consecutive (subsequent) segment of columns. I.e. consider four integers
x
1
,
x
2
,
y
1
,
y
2
(
1≤
x
1
≤
x
2
≤n
,
1≤
y
1
≤
y
2
≤m
) a subrectangle
c[
x
1
…
x
2
][
y
1
…
y
2
]
is an intersection of the rows
x
1
,
x
1
+1,
x
1
+2,…,
x
2
and the columns
y
1
,
y
1
+1,
y
1
+2,…,
y
2
.
The size (area) of a subrectangle is the total number of cells in it.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
and
k
(
1≤n,m≤40000,1≤k≤n⋅m
), length of array
a
, length of array
b
and required size of subrectangles.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤1
), elements of
a
.
The third line contains
m
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
m
(
0≤
b
i
≤1
), elements of
b
.
Output
Output single integer — the number of subrectangles of
c
with size (area)
k
consisting only of ones.
