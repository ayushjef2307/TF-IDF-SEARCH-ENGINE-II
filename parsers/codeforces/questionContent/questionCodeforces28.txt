You are given an unsorted permutation
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
. To sort the permutation, you choose a constant
k
(
k≥1
) and do some operations on the permutation. In one operation, you can choose two integers
i
,
j
(
1≤j<i≤n
) such that
i−j=k
, then swap
p
i
and
p
j
.
What is the maximum value of
k
that you can choose to sort the given permutation?
A permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
An unsorted permutation
p
is a permutation such that there is at least one position
i
that satisfies
p
i
≠i
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the permutation
p
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
distinct integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — the permutation
p
. It is guaranteed that the given numbers form a permutation of length
n
and the given permutation is unsorted.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output the maximum value of
k
that you can choose to sort the given permutation.
We can show that an answer always exists.

Note
In the first test case, the maximum value of
k
you can choose is
1
. The operations used to sort the permutation are:
Swap
p
2
and
p
1
(
2−1=1
)
→
p=[1,3,2]
Swap
p
2
and
p
3
(
3−2=1
)
→
p=[1,2,3]
In the second test case, the maximum value of
k
you can choose is
2
. The operations used to sort the permutation are:
Swap
p
3
and
p
1
(
3−1=2
)
→
p=[1,4,3,2]
Swap
p
4
and
p
2
(
4−2=2
)
→
p=[1,2,3,4]
