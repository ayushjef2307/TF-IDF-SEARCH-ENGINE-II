For a square matrix of integers of size
n×n
, let's define its beauty as follows: for each pair of side-adjacent elements
x
and
y
, write out the number
|x−y|
, and then find the number of different numbers among them.
For example, for the matrix
(
1
4
3
2
)
the numbers we consider are
|1−3|=2
,
|1−4|=3
,
|3−2|=1
and
|4−2|=2
; there are
3
different numbers among them (
2
,
3
and
1
), which means that its beauty is equal to
3
.
You are given an integer
n
. You have to find a matrix of size
n×n
, where each integer from
1
to
n
2
occurs exactly once, such that its beauty is the maximum possible among all such matrices.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤49
) – the number of test cases.
The first (and only) line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤50
).
Output
For each test case, print
n
rows of
n
integers — a matrix of integers of size
n×n
, where each number from
1
to
n
2
occurs exactly once, such that its beauty is the maximum possible among all such matrices. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
