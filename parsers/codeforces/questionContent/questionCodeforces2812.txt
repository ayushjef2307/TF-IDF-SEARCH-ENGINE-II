It is Professor R's last class of his teaching career. Every time Professor R taught a class, he gave a special problem for the students to solve. You being his favourite student, put your heart into solving it one last time.
You are given two polynomials
f(x)=
a
0
+
a
1
x+⋯+
a
n−1
x
n−1
and
g(x)=
b
0
+
b
1
x+⋯+
b
m−1
x
m−1
, with positive integral coefficients. It is guaranteed that the cumulative GCD of the coefficients is equal to
1
for both the given polynomials. In other words,
gcd(
a
0
,
a
1
,…,
a
n−1
)=gcd(
b
0
,
b
1
,…,
b
m−1
)=1
. Let
h(x)=f(x)⋅g(x)
. Suppose that
h(x)=
c
0
+
c
1
x+⋯+
c
n+m−2
x
n+m−2
.
You are also given a prime number
p
. Professor R challenges you to find any
t
such that
c
t
isn't divisible by
p
. He guarantees you that under these conditions such
t
always exists. If there are several such
t
, output any of them.
As the input is quite large, please use fast input reading methods.
Input
The first line of the input contains three integers,
n
,
m
and
p
(
1≤n,m≤
10
6
,2≤p≤
10
9
),  —
n
and
m
are the number of terms in
f(x)
and
g(x)
respectively (one more than the degrees of the respective polynomials) and
p
is the given prime number.
It is guaranteed that
p
is prime.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
0
,
a
1
,…,
a
n−1
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) —
a
i
is the coefficient of
x
i
in
f(x)
.
The third line contains
m
integers
b
0
,
b
1
,…,
b
m−1
(
1≤
b
i
≤
10
9
)  —
b
i
is the coefficient of
x
i
in
g(x)
.
Output
Print a single integer
t
(
0≤t≤n+m−2
)  — the appropriate power of
x
in
h(x)
whose coefficient isn't divisible by the given prime
p
. If there are multiple powers of
x
that satisfy the condition, print any.

Note
In the first test case,
f(x)
is
2
x
2
+x+1
and
g(x)
is
x+2
, their product
h(x)
being
2
x
3
+5
x
2
+3x+2
, so the answer can be 1 or 2 as both 3 and 5 aren't divisible by 2.
In the second test case,
f(x)
is
x+2
and
g(x)
is
x+3
, their product
h(x)
being
x
2
+5x+6
, so the answer can be any of the powers as no coefficient is divisible by the given prime.
