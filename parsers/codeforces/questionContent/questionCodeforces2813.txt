Vasya has a string
s
of length
n
. He decides to make the following modification to the string:
Pick an integer
k
, (
1≤k≤n
).
For
i
from
1
to
n−k+1
, reverse the substring
s[i:i+k−1]
of
s
. For example, if string
s
is qwer and
k=2
, below is the series of transformations the string goes through:
qwer (original string)
wqer (after reversing the first substring of length
2
)
weqr (after reversing the second substring of length
2
)
werq (after reversing the last substring of length
2
)
Hence, the resulting string after modifying
s
with
k=2
is werq.
Vasya wants to choose a
k
such that the string obtained after the above-mentioned modification is lexicographically smallest possible among all choices of
k
. Among all such
k
, he wants to choose the smallest one. Since he is busy attending Felicity 2020, he asks for your help.
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
if and only if one of the following holds:
a
is a prefix of
b
, but
a≠b
;
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases.
The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤5000
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5000
) — the length of the string
s
.
The second line of each test case contains the string
s
of
n
lowercase latin letters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5000
.
Output
For each testcase output two lines:
In the first line output the lexicographically smallest string
s
′
achievable after the above-mentioned modification.
In the second line output the appropriate value of
k
(
1≤k≤n
) that you chose for performing the modification. If there are multiple values of
k
that give the lexicographically smallest string, output the smallest value of
k
among them.

Note
In the first testcase of the first sample, the string modification results for the sample abab are as follows :
for
k=1
: abab
for
k=2
: baba
for
k=3
: abab
for
k=4
: baba
The lexicographically smallest string achievable through modification is abab for
k=1
and
3
. Smallest value of
k
needed to achieve is hence
1
.
