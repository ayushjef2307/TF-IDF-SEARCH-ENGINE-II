After a long party Petya decided to return home, but he turned out to be at the opposite end of the town from his home. There are
n
crossroads in the line in the town, and there is either the bus or the tram station at each crossroad.
The crossroads are represented as a string
s
of length
n
, where
si=A
, if there is a bus station at
i
-th crossroad, and
si=B
, if there is a tram station at
i
-th crossroad. Currently Petya is at the first crossroad (which corresponds to
s1
) and his goal is to get to the last crossroad (which corresponds to
sn
).
If for two crossroads
i
and
j
for all crossroads
i,i+1,…,j−1
there is a bus station, one can pay
a
roubles for the bus ticket, and go from
i
-th crossroad to the
j
-th crossroad by the bus (it is not necessary to have a bus station at the
j
-th crossroad). Formally, paying
a
roubles Petya can go from
i
to
j
if
st=A
for all
i≤t<j
.
If for two crossroads
i
and
j
for all crossroads
i,i+1,…,j−1
there is a tram station, one can pay
b
roubles for the tram ticket, and go from
i
-th crossroad to the
j
-th crossroad by the tram (it is not necessary to have a tram station at the
j
-th crossroad). Formally, paying
b
roubles Petya can go from
i
to
j
if
st=B
for all
i≤t<j
.
For example, if
s
="AABBBAB",
a=4
and
b=3
then Petya needs:
buy one bus ticket to get from
1
to
3
,
buy one tram ticket to get from
3
to
6
,
buy one bus ticket to get from
6
to
7
.
Thus, in total he needs to spend
4+3+4=11
roubles. Please note that the type of the stop at the last crossroad (i.e. the character
sn
) does not affect the final expense.
Now Petya is at the first crossroad, and he wants to get to the
n
-th crossroad. After the party he has left with
p
roubles. He's decided to go to some station on foot, and then go to home using only public transport.
Help him to choose the closest crossroad
i
to go on foot the first, so he has enough money to get from the
i
-th crossroad to the
n
-th, using only tram and bus tickets.
Input
Each test contains one or more test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤104
).
The first line of each test case consists of three integers
a,b,p
(
1≤a,b,p≤105
) — the cost of bus ticket, the cost of tram ticket and the amount of money Petya has.
The second line of each test case consists of one string
s
, where
si=A
, if there is a bus station at
i
-th crossroad, and
si=B
, if there is a tram station at
i
-th crossroad (
2≤|s|≤105
).
It is guaranteed, that the sum of the length of strings
s
by all test cases in one test doesn't exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case print one number — the minimal index
i
of a crossroad Petya should go on foot. The rest of the path (i.e. from
i
to
n
he should use public transport).
