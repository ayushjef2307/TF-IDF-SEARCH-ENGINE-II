Vasya had three strings
a
,
b
and
s
, which consist of lowercase English letters. The lengths of strings
a
and
b
are equal to
n
, the length of the string
s
is equal to
m
.
Vasya decided to choose a substring of the string
a
, then choose a substring of the string
b
and concatenate them. Formally, he chooses a segment
[
l
1
,
r
1
]
(
1≤
l
1
≤
r
1
≤n
) and a segment
[
l
2
,
r
2
]
(
1≤
l
2
≤
r
2
≤n
), and after concatenation he obtains a string
a[
l
1
,
r
1
]+b[
l
2
,
r
2
]=
a
l
1

l
1
+1
…
a
r
1
b
l
2
b
l
2
+1
…
b
r
2
.
Now, Vasya is interested in counting number of ways to choose those segments adhering to the following conditions:
segments
[
l
1
,
r
1
]
and
[
l
2
,
r
2
]
have non-empty intersection, i.e. there exists at least one integer
x
, such that
l
1
≤x≤
r
1
and
l
2
≤x≤
r
2
;
the string
a[
l
1
,
r
1
]+b[
l
2
,
r
2
]
is equal to the string
s
.
Input
The first line contains integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤500000,2≤m≤2⋅n
) — the length of strings
a
and
b
and the length of the string
s
.
The next three lines contain strings
a
,
b
and
s
, respectively. The length of the strings
a
and
b
is
n
, while the length of the string
s
is
m
.
All strings consist of lowercase English letters.
Output
Print one integer — the number of ways to choose a pair of segments, which satisfy Vasya's conditions.
