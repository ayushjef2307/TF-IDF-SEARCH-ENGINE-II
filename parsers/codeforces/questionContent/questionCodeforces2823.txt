Tired of boring office work, Denis decided to open a fast food restaurant.
On the first day he made
a
portions of dumplings,
b
portions of cranberry juice and
c
pancakes with condensed milk.
The peculiarity of Denis's restaurant is the procedure of ordering food. For each visitor Denis himself chooses a set of dishes that this visitor will receive. When doing so, Denis is guided by the following rules:
every visitor should receive at least one dish (dumplings, cranberry juice, pancakes with condensed milk are all considered to be dishes);
each visitor should receive no more than one portion of dumplings, no more than one portion of cranberry juice and no more than one pancake with condensed milk;
all visitors should receive different sets of dishes.
What is the maximum number of visitors Denis can feed?

Note
In the first test case of the example, Denis can feed the first visitor with dumplings, give the second a portion of cranberry juice, and give the third visitor a portion of cranberry juice and a pancake with a condensed milk.
In the second test case of the example, the restaurant Denis is not very promising: he can serve no customers.
In the third test case of the example, Denise can serve four visitors. The first guest will receive a full lunch of dumplings, a portion of cranberry juice and a pancake with condensed milk. The second visitor will get only dumplings. The third guest will receive a pancake with condensed milk, and the fourth guest will receive a pancake and a portion of dumplings. Please note that Denis hasn't used all of the prepared products, but is unable to serve more visitors.
