inputstandard input

There are
n
points on a coordinate axis
OX
. The
i
-th point is located at the integer point
xi
and has a speed
vi
. It is guaranteed that no two points occupy the same coordinate. All
n
points move with the constant speed, the coordinate of the
i
-th point at the moment
t
(
t
can be non-integer) is calculated as
xi+t⋅vi
.
Consider two points
i
and
j
. Let
d(i,j)
be the minimum possible distance between these two points over any possible moments of time (even non-integer). It means that if two points
i
and
j
coincide at some moment, the value
d(i,j)
will be
0
.
Your task is to calculate the value
∑
1≤i<j≤n
d(i,j)
(the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅105
) — the number of points.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
x1,x2,…,xn
(
1≤xi≤108
), where
xi
is the initial coordinate of the
i
-th point. It is guaranteed that all
xi
are distinct.
The third line of the input contains
n
integers
v1,v2,…,vn
(
−108≤vi≤108
), where
vi
is the speed of the
i
-th point.
Output
Print one integer — the value
∑
1≤i<j≤n
d(i,j)
(the sum of minimum distances over all pairs of points).
