2
n
teams will compete in a double-elimination format (please, carefully read problem statement even if you know what is it) to identify the champion.
Teams are numbered from
1
to
2
n
and will play games one-on-one. All teams start in the upper bracket.
All upper bracket matches will be held played between teams that haven't lost any games yet. Teams are split into games by team numbers. Game winner advances in the next round of upper bracket, losers drop into the lower bracket.
Lower bracket starts with
2
n−1
teams that lost the first upper bracket game. Each lower bracket round consists of two games. In the first game of a round
2
k
teams play a game with each other (teams are split into games by team numbers).
2
k−1
loosing teams are eliminated from the championship,
2
k−1
winning teams are playing
2
k−1
teams that got eliminated in this round of upper bracket (again, teams are split into games by team numbers). As a result of each round both upper and lower bracket have
2
k−1
teams remaining. See example notes for better understanding.
Single remaining team of upper bracket plays with single remaining team of lower bracket in grand-finals to identify championship winner.
