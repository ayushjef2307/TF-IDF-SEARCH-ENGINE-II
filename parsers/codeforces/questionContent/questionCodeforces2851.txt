Kuroni isn't good at economics. So he decided to found a new financial pyramid called Antihype. It has the following rules:
You can join the pyramid for free and get
0
coins.
If you are already a member of Antihype, you can invite your friend who is currently not a member of Antihype, and get a number of coins equal to your age (for each friend you invite).
n
people have heard about Antihype recently, the
i
-th person's age is
a
i
. Some of them are friends, but friendship is a weird thing now: the
i
-th person is a friend of the
j
-th person if and only if
a
i
 AND 
a
j
=0
, where
AND
denotes the bitwise AND operation.
Nobody among the
n
people is a member of Antihype at the moment. They want to cooperate to join and invite each other to Antihype in a way that maximizes their combined gainings. Could you help them?
