You are given a string
s
. You can build new string
p
from
s
using the following operation no more than two times:
choose any subsequence
s
i
1
,
s
i
2
,…,
s
i
k
where
1≤
i
1
<
i
2
<⋯<
i
k
≤|s|
;
erase the chosen subsequence from
s
(
s
can become empty);
concatenate chosen subsequence to the right of the string
p
(in other words,
p=p+
s
i
1
s
i
2
…
s
i
k
).
Of course, initially the string
p
is empty.
For example, let
s=ababcd
. At first, let's choose subsequence
s
1
s
4
s
5
=abc
— we will get
s=bad
and
p=abc
. At second, let's choose
s
1
s
2
=ba
— we will get
s=d
and
p=abcba
. So we can build
abcba
from
ababcd
.
Can you build a given string
t
using the algorithm above?
Input
The first line contains the single integer
T
(
1≤T≤100
) — the number of test cases.
Next
2T
lines contain test cases — two per test case. The first line contains string
s
consisting of lowercase Latin letters (
1≤|s|≤400
) — the initial string.
The second line contains string
t
consisting of lowercase Latin letters (
1≤|t|≤|s|
) — the string you'd like to build.
It's guaranteed that the total length of strings
s
doesn't exceed
400
.
Output
Print
T
answers — one per test case. Print YES (case insensitive) if it's possible to build
t
and NO (case insensitive) otherwise.
