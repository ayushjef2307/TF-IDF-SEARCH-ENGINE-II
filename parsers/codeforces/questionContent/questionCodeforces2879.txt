This is an unusual problem in an unusual contest, here is the announcement: http://codeforces.com/blog/entry/73543
You are given an array
A
of length
n
, initially filled with zeros. You need to process
q
queries to the array, each of one of the following types:
1 x y: you need to assign
A
x
=y
;
2 l r: you need to print
∑
i=l
r
A
i
.
Furthermore, there are
T
independent tests you need to process.
Input
The first line contains an integer
T
(
1≤T≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case description starts with two integers
n,q
(
1≤n,q≤
10
5
) — the length of the array and the number of queries. The following
q
lines contain the description of queries:
1 x y
(
1≤x≤n
,
0≤y≤
10
9
) for queries of the first type and
2 l r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) for queries of the second type.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
as well as the sum of
q
does not exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each query of the second type print its result on a separate line.
