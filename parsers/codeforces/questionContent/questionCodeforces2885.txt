Ayoub thinks that he is a very smart person, so he created a function
f(s)
, where
s
is a binary string (a string which contains only symbols "0" and "1"). The function
f(s)
is equal to the number of substrings in the string
s
that contains at least one symbol, that is equal to "1".
More formally,
f(s)
is equal to the number of pairs of integers
(l,r)
, such that
1≤l≤r≤|s|
(where
|s|
is equal to the length of string
s
), such that at least one of the symbols
s
l
,
s
l+1
,…,
s
r
is equal to "1".
For example, if
s=
"01010" then
f(s)=12
, because there are
12
such pairs
(l,r)
:
(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(1,5),(2,2),(2,3),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,4),(4,5)
.
Ayoub also thinks that he is smarter than Mahmoud so he gave him two integers
n
and
m
and asked him this problem. For all binary strings
s
of length
n
which contains exactly
m
symbols equal to "1", find the maximum value of
f(s)
.
Mahmoud couldn't solve the problem so he asked you for help. Can you help him?
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line for each test case contains two integers
n
,
m
(
1≤n≤
10
9
,
0≤m≤n
) — the length of the string and the number of symbols equal to "1" in it.
Output
For every test case print one integer number — the maximum value of
f(s)
over all strings
s
of length
n
, which has exactly
m
symbols, equal to "1".

Note
In the first test case, there exists only
3
strings of length
3
, which has exactly
1
symbol, equal to "1". These strings are:
s
1
=
"100",
s
2
=
"010",
s
3
=
"001". The values of
f
for them are:
f(
s
1
)=3,f(
s
2
)=4,f(
s
3
)=3
, so the maximum value is
4
and the answer is
4
.
In the second test case, the string
s
with the maximum value is "101".
In the third test case, the string
s
with the maximum value is "111".
In the fourth test case, the only string
s
of length
4
, which has exactly
0
symbols, equal to "1" is "0000" and the value of
f
for that string is
0
, so the answer is
0
.
In the fifth test case, the string
s
with the maximum value is "01010" and it is described as an example in the problem statement.
