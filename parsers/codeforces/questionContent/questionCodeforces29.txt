You are given a positive integer
n
. Please find an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
that is perfect.
A perfect array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
satisfies the following criteria:
1≤
a
i
≤1000
for all
1≤i≤n
.
a
i
is divisible by
i
for all
1≤i≤n
.
a
1
+
a
2
+…+
a
n
is divisible by
n
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤200
). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single positive integer
n
(
1≤n≤200
) — the length of the array
a
.
Output
For each test case, output an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
that is perfect.
We can show that an answer always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.
