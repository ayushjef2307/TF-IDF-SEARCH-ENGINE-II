Polycarp is working on the implementation of displaying likes on the Codehorses social network. The number of likes should be displayed in a format that will be easy to read by users. It was decided that for large numbers of likes the format should be like 123K (one hundred twenty-three thousand) or like 56M (fifty-six million).
The following displaying strategy has been approved:
the number will be displayed either as an integer number from 0 to 999, or as a positive integer number of thousands (from 1K to 999K), or as a positive integer number of millions (from 1M on),
the specified exact number of likes
n
when displaying should be rounded to the nearest view from the case above (if rounding is ambiguous, it must be rounded up): for example,
1785
should be rounded to 2K instead of 1K,
4500000
should be rounded to 5M.
Help Polycarp implement this part of the functionality: for a given non-negative integer number of likes
n
, print its view in the Codehorses interface.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases in the input. The following are descriptions of the
t
input test cases, one per line.
The description of each test case consists of a single line that contains a non-negative integer
n
(
0≤n≤2⋅
10
9
) — the number of likes.
Output
Print
t
answers to the given test cases in the order from the input. Each printed value must have one of the following types:
either an integer from 0 to 999 which corresponds just to the number of likes,
or a number of thousands from 1K to 999K,
or a number of millions from 1M to 2000M.
The answer is equal to a view which is the closest (by difference) to the given number
n
. If this rounding is ambiguous, then round answer up (to a greater value).

Note
Let's describe some test cases:
1782
can be displayed either as 1K or as 2K but 2K is the nearest view;
1500
have same difference with 1K and 2K so it should be rounded up;
999999
should be displayed as 1M since it's closer to it than to 999K.
