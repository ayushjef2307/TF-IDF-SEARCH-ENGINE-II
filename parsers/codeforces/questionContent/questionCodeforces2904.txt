There are
n
railway stations in Berland. They are connected to each other by
n−1
railway sections. The railway network is connected, i.e. can be represented as an undirected tree.
You have a map of that network, so for each railway section you know which stations it connects.
Each of the
n−1
sections has some integer value of the scenery beauty. However, these values are not marked on the map and you don't know them. All these values are from
1
to
10
6
inclusive.
You asked
m
passengers some questions: the
j
-th one told you three values:
his departure station
a
j
;
his arrival station
b
j
;
minimum scenery beauty along the path from
a
j
to
b
j
(the train is moving along the shortest path from
a
j
to
b
j
).
You are planning to update the map and set some value
f
i
on each railway section — the scenery beauty. The passengers' answers should be consistent with these values.
Print any valid set of values
f
1
,
f
2
,…,
f
n−1
, which the passengers' answer is consistent with or report that it doesn't exist.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤5000
) — the number of railway stations in Berland.
The next
n−1
lines contain descriptions of the railway sections: the
i
-th section description is two integers
x
i
and
y
i
(
1≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤n,
x
i
≠
y
i
), where
x
i
and
y
i
are the indices of the stations which are connected by the
i
-th railway section. All the railway sections are bidirected. Each station can be reached from any other station by the railway.
The next line contains a single integer
m
(
1≤m≤5000
) — the number of passengers which were asked questions. Then
m
lines follow, the
j
-th line contains three integers
a
j
,
b
j
and
g
j
(
1≤
a
j
,
b
j
≤n
;
a
j
≠
b
j
;
1≤
g
j
≤
10
6
) — the departure station, the arrival station and the minimum scenery beauty along his path.
Output
If there is no answer then print a single integer -1.
Otherwise, print
n−1
integers
f
1
,
f
2
,…,
f
n−1
(
1≤
f
i
≤
10
6
), where
f
i
is some valid scenery beauty along the
i
-th railway section.
If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
