Mishka wants to buy some food in the nearby shop. Initially, he has
s
burles on his card.
Mishka can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero): choose some positive integer number
1≤x≤s
, buy food that costs exactly
x
burles and obtain
⌊
x
10
⌋
burles as a cashback (in other words, Mishka spends
x
burles and obtains
⌊
x
10
⌋
back). The operation
⌊
a
b
⌋
means
a
divided by
b
rounded down.
It is guaranteed that you can always buy some food that costs
x
for any possible value of
x
.
Your task is to say the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.
For example, if Mishka has
s=19
burles then the maximum number of burles he can spend is
21
. Firstly, he can spend
x=10
burles, obtain
1
burle as a cashback. Now he has
s=10
burles, so can spend
x=10
burles, obtain
1
burle as a cashback and spend it too.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The next
t
lines describe test cases. Each test case is given on a separate line and consists of one integer
s
(
1≤s≤
10
9
) — the number of burles Mishka initially has.
Output
For each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of burles Mishka can spend if he buys food optimally.
