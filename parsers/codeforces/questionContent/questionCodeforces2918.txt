You are given a rectangular matrix of size
n×m
consisting of integers from
1
to
2⋅
10
5
.
In one move, you can:
choose any element of the matrix and change its value to any integer between
1
and
n⋅m
, inclusive;
take any column and shift it one cell up cyclically (see the example of such cyclic shift below).
A cyclic shift is an operation such that you choose some
j
(
1≤j≤m
) and set
a
1,j
:=
a
2,j
,
a
2,j
:=
a
3,j
,…,
a
n,j
:=
a
1,j
simultaneously.
Example of cyclic shift of the first column
You want to perform the minimum number of moves to make this matrix look like this:
In other words, the goal is to obtain the matrix, where
a
1,1
=1,
a
1,2
=2,…,
a
1,m
=m,
a
2,1
=m+1,
a
2,2
=m+2,…,
a
n,m
=n⋅m
(i.e.
a
i,j
=(i−1)⋅m+j
) with the minimum number of moves performed.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅
10
5
,n⋅m≤2⋅
10
5
) — the size of the matrix.
The next
n
lines contain
m
integers each. The number at the line
i
and position
j
is
a
i,j
(
1≤
a
i,j
≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
Print one integer — the minimum number of moves required to obtain the matrix, where
a
1,1
=1,
a
1,2
=2,…,
a
1,m
=m,
a
2,1
=m+1,
a
2,2
=m+2,…,
a
n,m
=n⋅m
(
a
i,j
=(i−1)m+j
).

Note
In the first example, you can set
a
1,1
:=7,
a
1,2
:=8
and
a
1,3
:=9
then shift the first, the second and the third columns cyclically, so the answer is
6
. It can be shown that you cannot achieve a better answer.
In the second example, the matrix is already good so the answer is
0
.
In the third example, it is enough to shift the second column cyclically twice to obtain a good matrix, so the answer is
2
.
