You are given one integer number
n
. Find three distinct integers
a,b,c
such that
2≤a,b,c
and
a⋅b⋅c=n
or say that it is impossible to do it.
If there are several answers, you can print any.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The next
n
lines describe test cases. The
i
-th test case is given on a new line as one integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, print the answer on it. Print "NO" if it is impossible to represent
n
as
a⋅b⋅c
for some distinct integers
a,b,c
such that
2≤a,b,c
.
Otherwise, print "YES" and any possible such representation.
