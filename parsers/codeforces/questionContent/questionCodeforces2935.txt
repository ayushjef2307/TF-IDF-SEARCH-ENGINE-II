Ildar is the algorithm teacher of William and Harris. Today, Ildar is teaching Cartesian Tree. However, Harris is sick, so Ildar is only teaching William.
A cartesian tree is a rooted tree, that can be constructed from a sequence of distinct integers. We build the cartesian tree as follows:
If the sequence is empty, return an empty tree;
Let the position of the maximum element be
x
;
Remove element on the position
x
from the sequence and break it into the left part and the right part (which might be empty) (not actually removing it, just taking it away temporarily);
Build cartesian tree for each part;
Create a new vertex for the element, that was on the position
x
which will serve as the root of the new tree. Then, for the root of the left part and right part, if exists, will become the children for this vertex;
Return the tree we have gotten.
For example, this is the cartesian tree for the sequence
4,2,7,3,5,6,1
:
After teaching what the cartesian tree is, Ildar has assigned homework. He starts with an empty sequence
a
.
In the
i
-th round, he inserts an element with value
i
somewhere in
a
. Then, he asks a question: what is the sum of the sizes of the subtrees for every node in the cartesian tree for the current sequence
a
?
Node
v
is in the node
u
subtree if and only if
v=u
or
v
is in the subtree of one of the vertex
u
children. The size of the subtree of node
u
is the number of nodes
v
such that
v
is in the subtree of
u
.
Ildar will do
n
rounds in total. The homework is the sequence of answers to the
n
questions.
The next day, Ildar told Harris that he has to complete the homework as well. Harris obtained the final state of the sequence
a
from William. However, he has no idea how to find the answers to the
n
questions. Help Harris!
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤150000
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
). It is guarenteed that each integer from
1
to
n
appears in the sequence exactly once.
Output
Print
n
lines,
i
-th line should contain a single integer  — the answer to the
i
-th question.
