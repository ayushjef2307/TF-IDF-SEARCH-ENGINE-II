Josuke received a huge undirected weighted complete
†
†
graph
G
as a gift from his grandfather. The graph contains
10
18
vertices. The peculiarity of the gift is that the weight of the edge between the different vertices
u
and
v
is equal to
gcd(u,v
)
‡
. Josuke decided to experiment and make a new graph
G
′
. To do this, he chooses two integers
l≤r
and deletes all vertices except such vertices
v
that
l≤v≤r
, and also deletes all the edges except between the remaining vertices.
Now Josuke is wondering how many different weights are there in
G
′
. Since their count turned out to be huge, he asks for your help.
†

A complete graph is a simple undirected graph in which every pair of distinct vertices is adjacent.
‡
‡
gcd(x,y)
denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers
x
and
y
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two numbers
l
,
r
(
1≤l≤r≤
10
18
,
l≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case print a single number — the number of different weights among the remaining edges.

Note
The graph
G
′
for the first test case.
The picture above shows that the graph has
2
different weights.
In the fifth test case, there is only one vertex from which no edges originate, so the answer is
0
.
