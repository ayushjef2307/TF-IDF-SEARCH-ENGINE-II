Adilbek was assigned to a special project. For Adilbek it means that he has
n
days to run a special program and provide its results. But there is a problem: the program needs to run for
d
days to calculate the results.
Fortunately, Adilbek can optimize the program. If he spends
x
(
x
is a non-negative integer) days optimizing the program, he will make the program run in
⌈
d
x+1
⌉
days (
⌈a⌉
is the ceiling function:
⌈2.4⌉=3
,
⌈2⌉=2
). The program cannot be run and optimized simultaneously, so the total number of days he will spend is equal to
x+⌈
d
x+1
⌉
.
Will Adilbek be able to provide the generated results in no more than
n
days?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
T
(
1≤T≤50
) — the number of test cases.
The next
T
lines contain test cases – one per line. Each line contains two integers
n
and
d
(
1≤n≤
10
9
,
1≤d≤
10
9
) — the number of days before the deadline and the number of days the program runs.
Output
Print
T
answers — one per test case. For each test case print YES (case insensitive) if Adilbek can fit in
n
days or NO (case insensitive) otherwise.

Note
In the first test case, Adilbek decides not to optimize the program at all, since
d≤n
.
In the second test case, Adilbek can spend
1
day optimizing the program and it will run
⌈
5
2
⌉=3
days. In total, he will spend
4
days and will fit in the limit.
In the third test case, it's impossible to fit in the limit. For example, if Adilbek will optimize the program
2
days, it'll still work
⌈
11
2+1
⌉=4
days.
