There are
n
segments on a
Ox
axis
[
l
1
,
r
1
]
,
[
l
2
,
r
2
]
, ...,
[
l
n
,
r
n
]
. Segment
[l,r]
covers all points from
l
to
r
inclusive, so all
x
such that
l≤x≤r
.
Segments can be placed arbitrarily  — be inside each other, coincide and so on. Segments can degenerate into points, that is
l
i
=
r
i
is possible.
Union of the set of segments is such a set of segments which covers exactly the same set of points as the original set. For example:
if
n=3
and there are segments
[3,6]
,
[100,100]
,
[5,8]
then their union is
2
segments:
[3,8]
and
[100,100]
;
if
n=5
and there are segments
[1,2]
,
[2,3]
,
[4,5]
,
[4,6]
,
[6,6]
then their union is
2
segments:
[1,3]
and
[4,6]
.
Obviously, a union is a set of pairwise non-intersecting segments.
You are asked to erase exactly one segment of the given
n
so that the number of segments in the union of the rest
n−1
segments is maximum possible.
For example, if
n=4
and there are segments
[1,4]
,
[2,3]
,
[3,6]
,
[5,7]
, then:
erasing the first segment will lead to
[2,3]
,
[3,6]
,
[5,7]
remaining, which have
1
segment in their union;
erasing the second segment will lead to
[1,4]
,
[3,6]
,
[5,7]
remaining, which have
1
segment in their union;
erasing the third segment will lead to
[1,4]
,
[2,3]
,
[5,7]
remaining, which have
2
segments in their union;
erasing the fourth segment will lead to
[1,4]
,
[2,3]
,
[3,6]
remaining, which have
1
segment in their union.
Thus, you are required to erase the third segment to get answer
2
.
Write a program that will find the maximum number of segments in the union of
n−1
segments if you erase any of the given
n
segments.
Note that if there are multiple equal segments in the given set, then you can erase only one of them anyway. So the set after erasing will have exactly
n−1
segments.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases in the test. Then the descriptions of
t
test cases follow.
The first of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of segments in the given set. Then
n
lines follow, each contains a description of a segment — a pair of integers
l
i
,
r
i
(
−
10
9
≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤
10
9
), where
l
i
and
r
i
are the coordinates of the left and right borders of the
i
-th segment, respectively.
The segments are given in an arbitrary order.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
Print
t
integers — the answers to the
t
given test cases in the order of input. The answer is the maximum number of segments in the union of
n−1
segments if you erase any of the given
n
segments.
