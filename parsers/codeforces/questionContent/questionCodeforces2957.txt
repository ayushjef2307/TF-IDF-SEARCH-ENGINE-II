Today, as a friendship gift, Bakry gave Badawy
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and challenged him to choose an integer
X
such that the value
max
1≤i≤n
(
a
i
⊕X)
is minimum possible, where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
As always, Badawy is too lazy, so you decided to help him and find the minimum possible value of
max
1≤i≤n
(
a
i
⊕X)
.
Input
The first line contains integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
2
30
−1
).
Output
Print one integer — the minimum possible value of
max
1≤i≤n
(
a
i
⊕X)
.
