Today, Osama gave Fadi an integer
X
, and Fadi was wondering about the minimum possible value of
max(a,b)
such that
LCM(a,b)
equals
X
. Both
a
and
b
should be positive integers.
LCM(a,b)
is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both
a
and
b
. For example,
LCM(6,8)=24
,
LCM(4,12)=12
,
LCM(2,3)=6
.
Of course, Fadi immediately knew the answer. Can you be just like Fadi and find any such pair?
Input
The first and only line contains an integer
X
(
1≤X≤
10
12
).
Output
Print two positive integers,
a
and
b
, such that the value of
max(a,b)
is minimum possible and
LCM(a,b)
equals
X
. If there are several possible such pairs, you can print any.
