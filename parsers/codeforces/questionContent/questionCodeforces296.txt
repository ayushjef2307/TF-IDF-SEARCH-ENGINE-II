While at Kira's house, Josuke saw a piece of paper on the table with a task written on it.
The task sounded as follows. There is an array
a
of length
n
. On this array, do the following:
select an integer
k>1
;
split the array into
k
subsegments
†
†
;
calculate the sum in each of
k
subsegments and write these sums to another array
b
(where the sum of the subsegment
(l,r)
is
∑
r
j=l
a
j
);
the final score of such a split will be
gcd(
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
k
)
‡
.
The task is to find such a partition that the score is maximum possible. Josuke is interested in this task but is not strong in computer science. Help him to find the maximum possible score.

A division of an array into
k
subsegments is
k
pairs of numbers
(
l
1
,
r
1
),(
l
2
,
r
2
),…,(
l
k
,
r
k
)
such that
l
i
≤
r
i
and for every
1≤j≤k−1
l
j+1
=
r
j
+1
, also
l
1
=1
and
r
k
=n
. These pairs represent the subsegments.
‡
‡
gcd(
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
k
)
stands for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the array
b
.
Input
The first line contains a single number
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the array
a
itself.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print a single integer — the maximum score for the optimal partition.

Note
In the first test case, you can choose
k=2
and split the array into subsegments
(1,2)
and
(3,4)
.
Then the score of such a partition will be equal to
gcd(
a
1
+
a
2
,
a
3
+
a
4
)=gcd(2+2,1+3)=gcd(4,4)=4
.
In the fourth test case, you can choose
k=3
and split the array into subsegments
(1,2),(3,5),(6,6)
.
The split score is
gcd(1+2,1+1+1,3)=3
.
