Recall that the permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
A sequence
a
is a subsegment of a sequence
b
if
a
can be obtained from
b
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. We will denote the subsegments as
[l,r]
, where
l,r
are two integers with
1≤l≤r≤n
. This indicates the subsegment where
l−1
elements from the beginning and
n−r
elements from the end are deleted from the sequence.
For a permutation
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
, we define a framed segment as a subsegment
[l,r]
where
max{
p
l
,
p
l+1
,…,
p
r
}−min{
p
l
,
p
l+1
,…,
p
r
}=r−l
. For example, for the permutation
(6,7,1,8,5,3,2,4)
some of its framed segments are:
[1,2],[5,8],[6,7],[3,3],[8,8]
. In particular, a subsegment
[i,i]
is always a framed segments for any
i
between
1
and
n
, inclusive.
We define the happiness of a permutation
p
as the number of pairs
(l,r)
such that
1≤l≤r≤n
, and
[l,r]
is a framed segment. For example, the permutation
[3,1,2]
has happiness
5
: all segments except
[1,2]
are framed segments.
Given integers
n
and
m
, Jongwon wants to compute the sum of happiness for all permutations of length
n
, modulo the prime number
m
. Note that there exist
n!
(factorial of
n
) different permutations of length
n
.
Input
The only line contains two integers
n

,
10

≤m≤
10
9
,
m
is prime).
Output
Print
r
(
0≤r<m
), the sum of happiness for all permutations of length
n
, modulo a prime number
m

Note
For sample input
n=3
, let's consider all permutations of length
3
:
[1,2,3]
, all subsegments are framed segment. Happiness is
6
.
[1,3,2]
, all subsegments except
[1,2]
are framed segment. Happiness is
5
.
[2,1,3]
, all subsegments except
[2,3]
are framed segment. Happiness is
5
.
[2,3,1]
, all subsegments except
[2,3]
are framed segment. Happiness is
5
.
[3,1,2]
, all subsegments except
[1,2]
are framed segment. Happiness is
5
.
[3,2,1]
, all subsegments are framed segment. Happiness is
6
.
Thus, the sum of happiness is
6+5+5+5+5+6=32
.
