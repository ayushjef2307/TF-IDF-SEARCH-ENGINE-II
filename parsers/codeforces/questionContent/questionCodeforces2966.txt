A sequence
a=[
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
l
]
of length
l
has an ascent if there exists a pair of indices
(i,j)
such that
1≤i<j≤l
and
a
i
<
a
j
. For example, the sequence
[0,2,0,2,0]
has an ascent because of the pair
(1,4)
, but the sequence
[4,3,3,3,1]
doesn't have an ascent.
Let's call a concatenation of sequences
p
and
q
the sequence that is obtained by writing down sequences
p
and
q
one right after another without changing the order. For example, the concatenation of the
[0,2,0,2,0]
and
[4,3,3,3,1]
is the sequence
[0,2,0,2,0,4,3,3,3,1]
. The concatenation of sequences
p
and
q
is denoted as
p+q
.
Gyeonggeun thinks that sequences with ascents bring luck. Therefore, he wants to make many such sequences for the new year. Gyeonggeun has
n
sequences
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
n
which may have different lengths.
Gyeonggeun will consider all
n
2
pairs of sequences
s
x
and
s
y
(
1≤x,y≤n
), and will check if its concatenation
s
x
+
s
y
has an ascent. Note that he may select the same sequence twice, and the order of selection matters.
Please count the number of pairs (
x,y
) of sequences
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
n
whose concatenation
s
x
+
s
y
contains an ascent.
Input
The first line contains the number
n
(
1≤n≤100000
) denoting the number of sequences.
The next
n
lines contain the number
l
i
(
1≤
l
i
) denoting the length of
s
i
, followed by
l
i
integers
s
i,1
,
s
i,2
,…,
s
i,
l
i
(
0≤
s
i,j
≤
10
6
) denoting the sequence
s
i
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of all
l
i
does not exceed
100000
.
Output
Print a single integer, the number of pairs of sequences whose concatenation has an ascent.

Note
For the first example, the following
9
arrays have an ascent:
[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,3],[1,4],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]
. Arrays with the same contents are counted as their occurences.
