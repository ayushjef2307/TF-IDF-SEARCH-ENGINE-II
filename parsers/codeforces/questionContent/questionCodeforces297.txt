Today Hayato came home from school with homework.
In the assignment, Hayato was given an array
a
of length
n
. The task was to find
3
numbers in this array whose sum is odd. At school, he claimed that there are such
3
numbers, but Hayato was not sure, so he asked you for help.
Answer if there are such three numbers, and if so, output indices
i
,
j
, and
k
such that
a
i
+
a
j
+
a
k
is odd.
The odd numbers are integers that are not divisible by
2
:
1
,
3
,
5
, and so on.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤300
) — the length of
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
5
) — the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, in the first line print one word "YES" (without quotes) if there are
3
numbers with an odd sum or "NO" (without quotes) if there are no such
3
numbers.
If the answer exists, then on the second line print
3
distinct integers
i,j,k
(
1≤i,j,k≤n
) — the indices of the numbers. If there are several answers, output any.

Note
In the first test case, there is one way to choose
3
numbers, and since
1+1+1=3
, this triple is fine for us.
In the second test case, you need to choose the numbers
1,2,2
, since
1+2+2=5
.
In the third test case, there is one way to choose three numbers, but
1+2+3=6
is an even number, so the required triple does not exist.
In the fifth test case, no matter what three numbers we choose, their sum is even.
