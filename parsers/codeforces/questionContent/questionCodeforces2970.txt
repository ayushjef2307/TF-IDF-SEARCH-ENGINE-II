There are
n
Christmas trees on an infinite number line. The
i
-th tree grows at the position
x
i
. All
x
i
are guaranteed to be distinct.
Each integer point can be either occupied by the Christmas tree, by the human or not occupied at all. Non-integer points cannot be occupied by anything.
There are
m
people who want to celebrate Christmas. Let
y
1
,
y
2
,…,
y
m
be the positions of people (note that all values
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
,
y
1
,
y
2
,…,
y
m
should be distinct and all
y
j
should be integer). You want to find such an arrangement of people that the value
∑
j=1
m
min
i=1
n
|
x
i
−
y
j
|
is the minimum possible (in other words, the sum of distances to the nearest Christmas tree for all people should be minimized).
In other words, let
d
j
be the distance from the
j
-th human to the nearest Christmas tree (
d
j
=
min
i=1
n
|
y
j
−
x
i
|
). Then you need to choose such positions
y
1
,
y
2
,…,
y
m
that
∑
j=1
m
d
j
is the minimum possible.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of Christmas trees and the number of people.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
(
−
10
9
≤
x
i
≤
10
9
), where
x
i
is the position of the
i
-th Christmas tree. It is guaranteed that all
x
i
are distinct.
Output
In the first line print one integer
res
— the minimum possible value of
∑
j=1
m
min
i=1
n
|
x
i
−
y
j
|
(in other words, the sum of distances to the nearest Christmas tree for all people).
In the second line print
m
integers
y
1
,
y
2
,…,
y
m
(
−2⋅
10
9
≤
y
j
≤2⋅
10
9
), where
y
j
is the position of the
j
-th human. All
y
j
should be distinct and all values
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
,
y
1
,
y
2
,…,
y
m
should be distinct.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
