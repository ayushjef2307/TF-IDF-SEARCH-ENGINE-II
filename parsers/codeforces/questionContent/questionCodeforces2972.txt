Santa has
n
candies and he wants to gift them to
k
kids. He wants to divide as many candies as possible between all
k
kids. Santa can't divide one candy into parts but he is allowed to not use some candies at all.
Suppose the kid who recieves the minimum number of candies has
a
candies and the kid who recieves the maximum number of candies has
b
candies. Then Santa will be satisfied, if the both conditions are met at the same time:
b−a≤1
(it means
b=a
or
b=a+1
);
the number of kids who has
a+1
candies (note that
a+1
not necessarily equals
b
) does not exceed
⌊
k
2
⌋
(less than or equal to
⌊
k
2
⌋
).
⌊
k
2
⌋
is
k
divided by
2
and rounded down to the nearest integer. For example, if
k=5
then
⌊
k
2
⌋=⌊
5
2
⌋=2
.
Your task is to find the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will be satisfied.
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤5⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The next
t
lines describe test cases. The
i
-th test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n,k≤
10
9
) — the number of candies and the number of kids.
Output
For each test case print the answer on it — the maximum number of candies Santa can give to kids so that he will be satisfied.

Note
In the first test case, Santa can give
3
and
2
candies to kids. There
a=2,b=3,a+1=3
.
In the second test case, Santa can give
5,5,4
and
4
candies. There
a=4,b=5,a+1=5
. The answer cannot be greater because then the number of kids with
5
candies will be
3
.
In the third test case, Santa can distribute candies in the following way:
[1,2,2,1,1,2,1]
. There
a=1,b=2,a+1=2
. He cannot distribute two remaining candies in a way to be satisfied.
In the fourth test case, Santa can distribute candies in the following way:
[3,3]
. There
a=3,b=3,a+1=4
. Santa distributed all
6
candies.
