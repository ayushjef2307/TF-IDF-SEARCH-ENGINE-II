We start with a string
s
consisting only of the digits
1
,
2
, or
3
. The length of
s
is denoted by
|s|
. For each
i
from
1
to
|s|
, the
i
-th character of
s
is denoted by
s
i
.
There is one cursor. The cursor's location
ℓ
is denoted by an integer in
{0,…,|s|}
, with the following meaning:
If
ℓ=0
, then the cursor is located before the first character of
s
.
If
ℓ=|s|
, then the cursor is located right after the last character of
s
.
If
0<ℓ<|s|
, then the cursor is located between
s
ℓ
and
s
ℓ+1
.
We denote by
s
left
the string to the left of the cursor and
s
right
the string to the right of the cursor.
We also have a string
c
, which we call our clipboard, which starts out as empty. There are three types of actions:
The Move action. Move the cursor one step to the right. This increments
ℓ
once.
The Cut action. Set
c←
s
right
, then set
s←
s
left
.
The Paste action. Append the value of
c
to the end of the string
s
. Note that this doesn't modify
c
.
The cursor initially starts at
ℓ=0
. Then, we perform the following procedure:
Perform the Move action once.
Perform the Cut action once.
Perform the Paste action
s
ℓ
times.
If
ℓ=x
, stop. Otherwise, return to step 1.
You're given the initial string
s
and the integer
x
. What is the length of
s
when the procedure stops? Since this value may be very large, only find it modulo
10
9
+7
.
It is guaranteed that
ℓ≤|s|
at any time.
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
x
(
1≤x≤
10
6
). The second line of each test case consists of the initial string
s
(
1≤|s|≤500
). It is guaranteed, that
s
consists of the characters "1", "2", "3".
It is guaranteed that the sum of
x
in a single file is at most
10
6
. It is guaranteed that in each test case before the procedure will stop it will be true that
ℓ≤|s|
at any time.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer for that test case modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
Let's illustrate what happens with the first test case. Initially, we have
s=
231. Initially,
ℓ=0
and
c=ε
(the empty string). The following things happen if we follow the procedure above:
Step 1, Move once: we get
ℓ=1
.
Step 2, Cut once: we get
s=
2 and
c=
31.
Step 3, Paste
s
ℓ
=
2 times: we get
s=
23131.
Step 4:
ℓ=1≠x=5
, so we return to step 1.
Step 1, Move once: we get
ℓ=2
.
Step 2, Cut once: we get
s=
23 and
c=
131.
Step 3, Paste
s
ℓ
=
3 times: we get
s=
23131131131.
Step 4:
ℓ=2≠x=5
, so we return to step 1.
Step 1, Move once: we get
ℓ=3
.
Step 2, Cut once: we get
s=
231 and
c=
31131131.
Step 3, Paste
s
ℓ
=
1 time: we get
s=
23131131131.
Step 4:
ℓ=3≠x=5
, so we return to step 1.
Step 1, Move once: we get
ℓ=4
.
Step 2, Cut once: we get
s=
2313 and
c=
1131131.
Step 3, Paste
s
ℓ
=
3 times: we get
s=
2313113113111311311131131.
Step 4:
ℓ=4≠x=5
, so we return to step 1.
Step 1, Move once: we get
ℓ=5
.
Step 2, Cut once: we get
s=
23131 and
c=
13113111311311131131.
Step 3, Paste
s
ℓ
=
1 times: we get
s=
2313113113111311311131131.
Step 4:
ℓ=5=x
, so we stop.
At the end of the procedure,
s
has length
25
.
