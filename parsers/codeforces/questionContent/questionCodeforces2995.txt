We had a really tough time generating tests for problem D. In order to prepare strong tests, we had to solve the following problem.
Given an undirected labeled tree consisting of
n
vertices, find a set of segments such that:
both endpoints of each segment are integers from
1
to
2n
, and each integer from
1
to
2n
should appear as an endpoint of exactly one segment;
all segments are non-degenerate;
for each pair
(i,j)
such that
i≠j
,
i∈[1,n]
and
j∈[1,n]
, the vertices
i
and
j
are connected with an edge if and only if the segments
i
and
j
intersect, but neither segment
i
is fully contained in segment
j
, nor segment
j
is fully contained in segment
i
.
Can you solve this problem too?
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
) — the number of vertices in the tree.
Then
n−1
lines follow, each containing two integers
x
i
and
y
i
(
1≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤n
,
x
i
≠
y
i
) denoting the endpoints of the
i
-th edge.
It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.
Output
Print
n
pairs of integers, the
i
-th pair should contain two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
<
r
i
≤2n
) — the endpoints of the
i
-th segment. All
2n
integers you print should be unique.
It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.
