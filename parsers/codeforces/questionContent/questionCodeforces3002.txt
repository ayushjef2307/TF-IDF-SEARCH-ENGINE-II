Hooray! Polycarp turned
n
years old! The Technocup Team sincerely congratulates Polycarp!
Polycarp celebrated all of his
n
birthdays: from the
1
-th to the
n
-th. At the moment, he is wondering: how many times he turned beautiful number of years?
According to Polycarp, a positive integer is beautiful if it consists of only one digit repeated one or more times. For example, the following numbers are beautiful:
1
,
77
,
777
,
44
and
999999
. The following numbers are not beautiful:
12
,
11110
,
6969
and
987654321
.
Of course, Polycarpus uses the decimal numeral system (i.e. radix is 10).
Help Polycarpus to find the number of numbers from
1
to
n
(inclusive) that are beautiful.
