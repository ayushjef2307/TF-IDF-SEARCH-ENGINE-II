Consider a string
s
of
n
lowercase English letters. Let
t
i
be the string obtained by replacing the
i
-th character of
s
with an asterisk character *. For example, when
s=abc
, we have
t
1
=∗bc
,
t
2
=a∗c
, and
t
3
=ab∗
.
Given a string
s
, count the number of distinct strings of lowercase English letters and asterisks that occur as a substring of at least one string in the set
{s,
t
1
,…,
t
n
}
. The empty string should be counted.
Note that *'s are just characters and do not play any special role as in, for example, regex matching.
Input
The only line contains a string
s
of
n
lowercase English letters (
1≤n≤
10
5
).
Output
Print a single integer — the number of distinct strings of
s,
t
1
,…,
t
n
.
Example
input
Copy
abc
output
Copy
15
Note
For the sample case, the distinct substrings are (empty string), a, b, c, *, ab, a*, bc, b*, *b, *c, abc, ab*, a*c, *bc.
