You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers. In one move, you can jump from the position
i
to the position
i−
a
i
(if
1≤i−
a
i
) or to the position
i+
a
i
(if
i+
a
i
≤n
).
For each position
i
from
1
to
n
you want to know the minimum the number of moves required to reach any position
j
such that
a
j
has the opposite parity from
a
i
(i.e. if
a
i
is odd then
a
j
has to be even and vice versa).
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of elements in
a
.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
), where
a
i
is the
i
-th element of
a
.

such that
a

has the opposite parity from

(i.e. if
a
