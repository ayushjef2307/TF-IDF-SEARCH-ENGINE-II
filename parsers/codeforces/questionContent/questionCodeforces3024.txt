At first, let's define function
f(x)
as follows:
f(x)
=
{
x
2
x−1
if x is even
otherwise 
We can see that if we choose some value
v
and will apply function
f
to it, then apply
f
to
f(v)
, and so on, we'll eventually get
1
. Let's write down all values we get in this process in a list and denote this list as
path(v)
. For example,
path(1)=[1]
,
path(15)=[15,14,7,6,3,2,1]
,
path(32)=[32,16,8,4,2,1]
.
Let's write all lists
path(x)
for every
x
from
1
to
n
. The question is next: what is the maximum value
y
such that
y
is contained in at least
k
different lists
path(x)
?
Formally speaking, you need to find maximum
y
such that
|{x | 1≤x≤n,y∈path(x)}|≥k
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤
10
18
).
Output
Print the only integer — the maximum value that is contained in at least
k
paths.

Note
In the first example, the answer is
5
, since
5
occurs in
path(5)
,
path(10)
and
path(11)
.
In the second example, the answer is
4
, since
4
occurs in
path(4)
,
path(5)
,
path(8)
,
path(9)
,
path(10)
and
path(11)
.
In the third example
n=k
, so the answer is
1
, since
1
is the only number occuring in all paths for integers from
1
to
20
.
