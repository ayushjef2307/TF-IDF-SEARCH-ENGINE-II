For an array
a
of integers let's denote its maximal element as
max(a)
, and minimal as
min(a)
. We will call an array
a
of
k
integers interesting if
max(a)−min(a)≥k
. For example, array
[1,3,4,3]
isn't interesting as
max(a)−min(a)=4−1=3<4
while array
[7,3,0,4,3]
is as
max(a)−min(a)=7−0=7≥5
.
You are given an array
a
of
n
integers. Find some interesting nonempty subarray of
a
, or tell that it doesn't exist.
An array
b
is a subarray of an array
a
if
b
can be obtained from
a
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end. In particular, an array is a subarray of itself.
Input
The first line contains integer number
t
(
1≤t≤10000
). Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output "NO" in a separate line if there is no interesting nonempty subarray in
a
.
Otherwise, output "YES" in a separate line. In the next line, output two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) — bounds of the chosen subarray. If there are multiple answers, print any.
You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note
In the second test case of the example, one of the interesting subarrays is
a=[2,0,1,9]
:
max(a)−min(a)=9−0=9≥4
.
