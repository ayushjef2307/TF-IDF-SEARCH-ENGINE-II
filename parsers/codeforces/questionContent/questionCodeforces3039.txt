Let's call a positive integer composite if it has at least one divisor other than
1
and itself. For example:
the following numbers are composite:
1024
,
4
,
6
,
9
;
the following numbers are not composite:
13
,
1
,
2
,
3
,
37
.
You are given a positive integer
n
. Find two composite integers
a,b
such that
a−b=n
.
It can be proven that solution always exists.
Input
The input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤107
): the given integer.
Output
Print two composite integers
a,b
(
2≤a,b≤109,a−b=n
).
It can be proven, that solution always exists.
If there are several possible solutions, you can print any.
