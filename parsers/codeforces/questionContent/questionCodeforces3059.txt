Let
a
be a matrix of size
r×c
containing positive integers, not necessarily distinct. Rows of the matrix are numbered from
1
to
r
, columns are numbered from
1
to
c
. We can construct an array
b
consisting of
r+c
integers as follows: for each
i∈[1,r]
, let
b
i
be the greatest common divisor of integers in the
i
-th row, and for each
j∈[1,c]
let
b
r+j
be the greatest common divisor of integers in the
j
-th column.
We call the matrix diverse if all
r+c
numbers
b
k
(
k∈[1,r+c]
) are pairwise distinct.
The magnitude of a matrix equals to the maximum of
b
k
.
For example, suppose we have the following matrix:
(
2
4
9
144
7
84
)
We construct the array
b
:
b
1
is the greatest common divisor of
2
,
9
, and
7
, that is
1
;
b
2
is the greatest common divisor of
4
,
144
, and
84
, that is
4
;
b
3
is the greatest common divisor of
2
and
4
, that is
2
;
b
4
is the greatest common divisor of
9
and
144
, that is
9
;
b
5
is the greatest common divisor of
7
and
84
, that is
7
.
So
b=[1,4,2,9,7]
. All values in this array are distinct, so the matrix is diverse. The magnitude is equal to
9
.
For a given
r
and
c
, find a diverse matrix that minimises the magnitude. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them. If there are no solutions, output a single integer
0
.
Input
The only line in the input contains two space separated integers
r
and
c
(
1≤r,c≤500
) — the number of rows and the number of columns of the matrix to be found.
Output
If there is no solution, output a single integer
0
.
Otherwise, output
r
rows. The
i
-th of them should contain
c
space-separated integers, the
j
-th of which is
a
i,j
— the positive integer in the
i
-th row and
j
-th column of a diverse matrix minimizing the magnitude.
Furthermore, it must hold that
1≤
a
i,j
≤
10
9
. It can be shown that if a solution exists, there is also a solution with this additional constraint (still having minimum possible magnitude).

Note
In the first example, the GCDs of rows are
b
1
=4
and
b
2
=1
, and the GCDs of columns are
b
3
=2
and
b
4
=3
. All GCDs are pairwise distinct and the maximum of them is
4
. Since the GCDs have to be distinct and at least
1
, it is clear that there are no diverse matrices of size
2×2
with magnitude smaller than
4
.
In the second example, no matter what
a
1,1
is,
b
1
=
b
2
will always hold, so there are no diverse matrices.
