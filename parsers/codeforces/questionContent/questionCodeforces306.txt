You are given a rooted tree consisting of
n
vertices numbered from
1
to
n
. Vertex
1
is the root of the tree. Each vertex has an integer value. The value of
i
-th vertex is
a
i
. You can do the following operation at most
k
times.
Choose a vertex
v
that has not been chosen before and an integer
x
such that
x
is a common divisor of the values of all vertices of the subtree of
v
. Multiply by
x
the value of each vertex in the subtree of
v
.
What is the maximum possible value of the root node
1
after at most
k
operations? Formally, you have to maximize the value of
a
1
.
A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the root. The subtree of a node
u
is the set of all nodes
y
such that the simple path from
y
to the root passes through
u
. Note that
u
is in the subtree of
u
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤50000
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤
10
5
,
0≤k≤n
) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of operations.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤1000
), where
a
i
denotes the value of vertex
i
.
Each of the next
n−1
lines contains two integers
u
i
and
v
i
(
1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n
,
u
i
≠
v
i
), denoting the edge of the tree between vertices
u
i
and
v
i
. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output the maximum value of the root after performing at most
k
operations.

Note
Both examples have the same tree:
For the first test case, you can do two operations as follows:
Choose the subtree of vertex
4
and
x=2
.
After this operation, the node values become
{24,12,24,12,12}.
Choose the subtree of vertex
1
and
x=12
.
After this operation, the node values become
{288,144,288,144,144}.
The value of the root is
288
and it is the maximum.
For the second test case, you can do three operations as follows:
Choose the subtree of vertex
4
and
x=2
.
After this operation, the node values become
{24,12,24,12,12}.
Choose the subtree of vertex
2
and
x=4
.
After this operation, the node values become
{24,48,24,48,48}.
Choose the subtree of vertex
1
and
x=24
.
After this operation, the node values become
{576,1152,576,1152,1152}.
The value of the root is
576
and it is the maximum.
