Bob is a competitive programmer. He wants to become red, and for that he needs a strict training regime. He went to the annual meeting of grandmasters and asked
n
of them how much effort they needed to reach red.
"Oh, I just spent
x
i
hours solving problems", said the
i
-th of them.
Bob wants to train his math skills, so for each answer he wrote down the number of minutes (
60⋅
x
i
), thanked the grandmasters and went home. Bob could write numbers with leading zeroes — for example, if some grandmaster answered that he had spent
2
hours, Bob could write
000120
instead of
120
.
Alice wanted to tease Bob and so she took the numbers Bob wrote down, and for each of them she did one of the following independently:
rearranged its digits, or
wrote a random number.
This way, Alice generated
n
numbers, denoted
y
1
, ...,
y
n
.
For each of the numbers, help Bob determine whether
y
i
can be a permutation of a number divisible by
60
(possibly with leading zeroes).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤418
) — the number of grandmasters Bob asked.
Then
n
lines follow, the
i
-th of which contains a single integer
y
i
 — the number that Alice wrote down.
Each of these numbers has between
2
and
100
digits '0' through '9'. They can contain leading zeroes.
Output
Output
n
lines.
For each
i
, output the following. If it is possible to rearrange the digits of
y
i
such that the resulting number is divisible by
60
, output "red" (quotes for clarity). Otherwise, output "cyan".

Note
In the first example, there is one rearrangement that yields a number divisible by
60
, and that is
360
.
In the second example, there are two solutions. One is
060
and the second is
600
.
In the third example, there are
6
possible rearrangments:
025
,
052
,
205
,
250
,
502
,
520
. None of these numbers is divisible by
60
.
In the fourth example, there are
3
rearrangements:
228
,
282
,
822
.
In the fifth example, none of the
24
rearrangements result in a number divisible by
60
.
In the sixth example, note that
000…0
is a valid solution.
