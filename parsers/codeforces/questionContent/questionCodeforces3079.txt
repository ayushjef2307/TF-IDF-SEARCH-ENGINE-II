You're given a tree with
n
vertices. The color of the
i
-th vertex is
h
i
.
The value of the tree is defined as
∑
h
i
=
h
j
,1≤i<j≤n
dis(i,j)
, where
dis(i,j)
is the number of edges on the shortest path between
i
and
j
.
The color of each vertex is lost, you only remember that
h
i
can be any integer from
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
(inclusive). You want to calculate the sum of values of all trees meeting these conditions modulo
10
9
+7
(the set of edges is fixed, but each color is unknown, so there are
∏
i=1
n
(
r
i
−
l
i
+1)
different trees).
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of vertices.
Then
n
lines follow, each line contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤
10
5
) denoting the range of possible colors of vertex
i
.
Then
n−1
lines follow, each containing two integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u,v≤n
,
u≠v
) denoting an edge of the tree. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.
Output
Print one integer — the sum of values of all possible trees, taken modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
In the first example there are four different ways to color the tree (so, there are four different trees):
a tree with vertices colored as follows:
{1,1,1,1}
. The value of this tree is
dis(1,2)+dis(1,3)+dis(1,4)+dis(2,3)+dis(2,4)+dis(3,4)=10
;
a tree with vertices colored as follows:
{1,2,1,1}
. The value of this tree is
dis(1,3)+dis(1,4)+dis(3,4)=4
;
a tree with vertices colored as follows:
{1,1,1,2}
. The value of this tree is
dis(1,2)+dis(1,3)+dis(2,3)=4
;
a tree with vertices colored as follows:
{1,2,1,2}
. The value of this tree is
dis(1,3)+dis(2,4)=4
.
Overall the sum of all values is
10+4+4+4=22
.
