You are given two binary strings
a
and
b
of length
n
. In each move, the string
a
is modified in the following way.
An index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) is chosen uniformly at random. The character
a
i
will be flipped. That is, if
a
i
is
0
, it becomes
1
, and if
a
i
is
1
, it becomes
0
.
What is the expected number of moves required to make both strings equal for the first time?
A binary string is a string, in which the character is either
0
or
1
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
6
) — the length of the strings.
The second line of each test case contains the binary string
a
of length
n
.
The third line of each test case contains the binary string
b
of length
n
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the expected number of moves modulo
998244353
.
Formally, let
M=998244353
. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction
p
q
, where
p
and
q
are integers and
q≢0(modM)
. Output the integer equal to
p⋅
q
−1
modM
. In other words, output such an integer
x
that
0≤x<M
and
x⋅q≡p(modM)
.

Note
In the first test case, index
1
is chosen randomly and
a
1
is flipped. After the move, the strings
a
and
b
are equal. The expected number of moves is
1
.
The strings
a
and
b
are already equal in the second test case. So, the expected number of moves is
0
.
The expected number of moves for the third and fourth test cases are
56
3
and
125
3
respectively.
