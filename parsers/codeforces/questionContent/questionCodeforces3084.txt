Several days ago you bought a new house and now you are planning to start a renovation. Since winters in your region can be very cold you need to decide how to heat rooms in your house.
Your house has
n
rooms. In the
i
-th room you can install at most
c
i
heating radiators. Each radiator can have several sections, but the cost of the radiator with
k
sections is equal to
k
2
burles.
Since rooms can have different sizes, you calculated that you need at least
su
m
i
sections in total in the
i
-th room.
For each room calculate the minimum cost to install at most
c
i
radiators with total number of sections not less than
su
m
i
.
Input
The first line contains single integer
n
(
1≤n≤1000
) — the number of rooms.
Each of the next
n
lines contains the description of some room. The
i
-th line contains two integers
c
i
and
su
m
i
(
1≤
c
i
,su
m
i
≤
10
4
) — the maximum number of radiators and the minimum total number of sections in the
i
-th room, respectively.
Output
For each room print one integer — the minimum possible cost to install at most
c
i
radiators with total number of sections not less than
su
m
i
.

Note
In the first room, you can install only one radiator, so it's optimal to use the radiator with
su
m
1
sections. The cost of the radiator is equal to
(

)
2
=

8
.
In the second room, you can install up to
10
4
radiators, but since you need only one section in total, it's optimal to buy one radiator with one section.
In the third room, there
7
variants to install radiators:

,
[5,1]
,
[4,2]
,
[3,3]
,
[2,4]
,
[1,5]
,
[0,6]
. The optimal variant is
[3,3]
and it costs
