You are given a permutation
p
of length
n
, an array of
m
distinct integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
m
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
), and an integer
d
.
Let
pos(x)
be the index of
x
in the permutation
p
. The array
a
is not good if
pos(
a
i
)<pos(
a
i+1
)≤pos(
a
i
)+d
for all
1≤i<m
.
For example, with the permutation
p=[4,2,1,3,6,5]
and
d=2
:
a=[2,3,6]
is a not good array.
a=[2,6,5]
is good because
pos(
a
1
)=2
,
pos(
a
2
)=5
, so the condition
pos(
a
2
)≤pos(
a
1
)+d
is not satisfied.
a=[1,6,3]
is good because
pos(
a
2
)=5
,
pos(
a
3
)=4
, so the condition
pos(
a
2
)<pos(
a
3
)
is not satisfied.
In one move, you can swap two adjacent elements of the permutation
p
. What is the minimum number of moves needed such that the array
a
becomes good? It can be shown that there always exists a sequence of moves so that the array
a
becomes good.
A permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
, but there is
4
in the array).
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
m
and
d
(
2≤n≤
10
5
,
2≤m≤n
,
1≤d≤n
), the length of the permutation
p
, the length of the array
a
and the value of
d
.
The second line contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
,
p
i
≠
p
j
for
i≠j
).
The third line contains
m
distinct integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
m
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
,
a
i
≠
a
j
for
i≠j
).
The sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
5⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print the minimum number of moves needed such that the array
a
becomes good.

Note
In the first case,
pos(
a
1
)=1
,
pos(
a
2
)=3
. To make the array good, one way is to swap
p
3
and
p
4
. After that, the array
a
will be good because the condition
pos(
a
2
)≤pos(
a
1
)+d
won't be satisfied.
In the second case,
pos(
a
1
)=1
,
pos(
a
2
)=4
. The
3
moves could be:
Swap
p
3
and
p
4
.
Swap
p
2
and
p
3
.
Swap
p
1
and
p
2
.
After these moves, the permutation
p
will be
[2,5,4,3,1]
. The array
a
will be good because the condition
pos(
a
1
)<pos(
a
2
)
won't be satisfied. It can be shown that you can't make the array
a
good with fewer moves.
In the third case,
pos(
a
1
)=1
,
pos(
a
2
)=3
,
pos(
a
3
)=5
. The
2
moves can be:
Swap
p
4
and
p
5
.
Swap
p
3
and
p
4
.
After these moves, the permutation
p
will be
[3,4,2,1,5]
. The array
a
will be good because the condition
pos(
a
2
)<pos(
a
3
)
won't be satisfied. It can be shown that you can't make the array
a
good with fewer moves.
In the fourth case,
pos(
a
1
)=2
,
pos(
a
2
)=1
. The array
a
is already good.
In the fifth case,
pos(
a
1
)=2
,
pos(
a
2
)=5
. The
2
moves are:
Swap
p
1
and
p
2
.
Swap
p
5
and
p
6
.
