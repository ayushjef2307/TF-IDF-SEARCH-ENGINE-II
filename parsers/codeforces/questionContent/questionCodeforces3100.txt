Bob watches TV every day. He always sets the volume of his TV to
b
. However, today he is angry to find out someone has changed the volume to
a
. Of course, Bob has a remote control that can change the volume.
There are six buttons (
−5,−2,−1,+1,+2,+5
) on the control, which in one press can either increase or decrease the current volume by
1
,
2
, or
5
. The volume can be arbitrarily large, but can never be negative. In other words, Bob cannot press the button if it causes the volume to be lower than
0
.
As Bob is so angry, he wants to change the volume to
b
using as few button presses as possible. However, he forgets how to do such simple calculations, so he asks you for help. Write a program that given
a
and
b
, finds the minimum number of presses to change the TV volume from
a
to
b
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
T
(
1≤T≤1000
). Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of one line containing two integers
a
and
b
(
0≤a,b≤
10
9
) — the current volume and Bob's desired volume, respectively.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of presses to change the TV volume from
a
to
b
. If Bob does not need to change the volume (i.e.
a=b
), then print
0
.

Note
In the first example, Bob can press the
−2
button twice to reach
0
. Note that Bob can not press
−5
when the volume is
4
since it will make the volume negative.
In the second example, one of the optimal ways for Bob is to press the
+5
twice, then press
−1
once.
In the last example, Bob can press the
+5
once, then press
+1
.
