You are given an array of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. The integers are either
1
or
−1
. You have to perform the following operation exactly once on the array
a
:
Choose an index
i
(
1≤i<n
) and flip the signs of
a
i
and
a
i+1
. Here, flipping the sign means
−1
will be
1
and
1
will be
−1
.
What is the maximum possible value of
a
1
+
a
2
+…+
a
n
after applying the above operation?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤500
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
), the length of the array
a
.
The next line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
a
i
=1
or
a
i
=−1
).
The sum of
n
over all cases doesn't exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print the maximum possible sum of the array
a
you can get in a separate line.

Note
In the first case, we can choose index
4
and flip the signs of
a
4
and
a
5
. After this operation, the sum will be
−1+1+1+1+1=3
. We can't make the sum larger than this.
In the third case, the only option is to choose the index
1
.
