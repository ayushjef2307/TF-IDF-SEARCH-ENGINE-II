Adding two numbers several times is a time-consuming task, so you want to build a robot. The robot should have a string
S=
S
1
S
2
…
S
N
of
N
characters on its memory that represents addition instructions. Each character of the string,
S
i
, is either 'A' or 'B'.
You want to be able to give
Q
commands to the robot, each command is either of the following types:
1
L
R
. The robot should toggle all the characters of
S
i
where
L≤i≤R
. Toggling a character means changing it to 'A' if it was previously 'B', or changing it to 'B' if it was previously 'A'.
2
L
R
A
B
. The robot should call
f(L,R,A,B)
and return two integers as defined in the following pseudocode:
    function f(L, R, A, B):
      FOR i from L to R
        if S[i] = 'A'
          A = A + B
        else
          B = A + B
      return (A, B)
   You want to implement the robot's expected behavior.
Input
Input begins with a line containing two integers:
N
Q
(
1≤N,Q≤100000
) representing the number of characters in the robot's memory and the number of commands, respectively. The next line contains a string
S
containing
N
characters (each either 'A' or 'B') representing the initial string in the robot's memory. The next
Q
lines each contains a command of the following types.
1
L
R
(
1≤L≤R≤N
)
2
L
R
A
B
(
1≤L≤R≤N
;
0≤A,B≤
10
9
)
There is at least one command of the second type.
Output
For each command of the second type in the same order as input, output in a line two integers (separated by a single space), the value of
A
and
B
returned by
f(L,R,A,B)
, respectively. As this output can be large, you need to modulo the output by
1000000007
.

Note
Explanation for the sample input/output #1
For the first command, calling
f(L,R,A,B)
causes the following:
Initially,
A=1
and
B=1
.
At the end of
i=1
,
A=2
and
B=1
.
At the end of
i=2
,
A=2
and
B=3
.
At the end of
i=3
,
A=5
and
B=3
.
At the end of
i=4
,
A=8
and
B=3
.
At the end of
i=5
,
A=11
and
B=3
.
Therefore,
f(L,R,A,B)
will return
(11,3)
.
For the second command, string
S
will be updated to "ABBBB".
For the third command, the value of
A
will always be
0
and the value of
B
will always be
1000000000
. Therefore,
f(L,R,A,B)
will return
(0,1000000000)
.
