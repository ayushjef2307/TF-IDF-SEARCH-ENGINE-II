You have a grid
G
containing
R
rows (numbered from
1
to
R
, top to bottom) and
C
columns (numbered from
1
to
C
, left to right) of uppercase characters. The character in the
r
th
row and the
c
th
column is denoted by
G
r,c
. You also have
Q
strings containing uppercase characters. For each of the string, you want to find the number of occurrences of the string in the grid.
An occurrence of string
S
in the grid is counted if
S
can be constructed by starting at one of the cells in the grid, going right
0
or more times, and then going down
0
or more times. Two occurrences are different if the set of cells used to construct the string is different. Formally, for each string
S
, you would like to count the number of tuples
⟨r,c,Δr,Δc⟩
such that:
1≤r≤R
and
r≤r+Δr≤R
1≤c≤C
and
c≤c+Δc≤C
S=
G
r,c
G
r,c+1
…
G
r,c+Δc
G
r+1,c+Δc
…
G
r+Δr,c+Δc
Input
Input begins with a line containing three integers:
R
C
Q
(
1≤R,C≤500
;
1≤Q≤200000
) representing the size of the grid and the number of strings, respectively. The next
R
lines each contains
C
uppercase characters representing the grid. The
c
th
character on the
r
th
line is
G
r,c
. The next
Q
lines each contains a string
S
containing uppercase characters. The length of this string is a positive integer not more than
200000
. The sum of the length of all
Q
strings combined is not more than
200000
.
Output
For each query in the same order as input, output in a line an integer representing the number of occurrences of the string in the grid.

Note
Explanation for the sample input/output #1
There are
2
occurrences of "ABC", represented by the tuples
⟨1,1,1,1⟩
and
⟨1,1,0,2⟩
.
There are
3
occurrences of "BC", represented by the tuples
⟨1,2,0,1⟩
,
⟨1,2,1,0⟩
, and
⟨2,1,0,1⟩
.
There is
1
occurrence of "BD", represented by the tuple
⟨2,1,1,0⟩
.
There is no occurrence of "AC".
There are
2
occurrences of "A", represented by the tuples
⟨1,1,0,0⟩
and
⟨3,2,0,0⟩
.
