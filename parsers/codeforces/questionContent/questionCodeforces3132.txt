Polycarpus has a complex electronic device. The core of this device is a circuit board. The board has
10
9
contact points which are numbered from
1
to
10
9
. Also there are
n
wires numbered from
1
to
n
, each connecting two distinct contact points on the board. An electric signal can pass between wires
A
and
B
if:
either both wires share the same contact point;
or there is a sequence of wires starting with
A
and ending with
B
, and each pair of adjacent wires in the sequence share a contact point.
The picture shows a circuit board with
5
wires. Contact points with numbers
2,5,7,8,10,13
are used. Here an electrical signal can pass from wire
2
to wire
3
, but not to wire
1
.
Currently the circuit board is broken. Polycarpus thinks that the board could be fixed if the wires were re-soldered so that a signal could pass between any pair of wires.
It takes
1
minute for Polycarpus to re-solder an end of a wire. I.e. it takes one minute to change one of the two contact points for a wire. Any contact point from range
[1,
10
9
]
can be used as a new contact point. A wire's ends must always be soldered to distinct contact points. Both wire's ends can be re-solded, but that will require two actions and will take
2
minutes in total.
Find the minimum amount of time Polycarpus needs to re-solder wires so that a signal can pass between any pair of wires. Also output an optimal sequence of wire re-soldering.
Input
The input contains one or several test cases. The first input line contains a single integer
t
— number of test cases. Then,
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of wires. The following
n
lines describe wires, each line containing two space-separated integers
x
i
,
y
i
(
1≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤
10
9
,
x
i
≠
y
i
) — contact points connected by the
i
-th wire. A couple of contact points can be connected with more than one wire.
Sum of values of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case first print one line with a single integer
k
— the minimum number of minutes needed to re-solder wires so that a signal can pass between any pair of wires. In the following
k
lines print the description of re-solderings. Each re-soldering should be described by three integers
w
j
,
a
j
,
b
j
(
1≤
w
j
≤n
,
1≤
a
j
,
b
j
≤
10
9
). Such triple means that during the
j
-th re-soldering an end of the
w
j
-th wire, which was soldered to contact point
a
j
, becomes soldered to contact point
b
j
instead. After each re-soldering of a wire it must connect two distinct contact points. If there are multiple optimal re-solderings, print any of them.
