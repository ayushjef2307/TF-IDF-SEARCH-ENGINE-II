The Berland Army is preparing for a large military parade. It is already decided that the soldiers participating in it will be divided into
k
rows, and all rows will contain the same number of soldiers.
Of course, not every arrangement of soldiers into
k
rows is suitable. Heights of all soldiers in the same row should not differ by more than
1
. The height of each soldier is an integer between
1
and
n
.
For each possible height, you know the number of soldiers having this height. To conduct a parade, you have to choose the soldiers participating in it, and then arrange all of the chosen soldiers into
k
rows so that both of the following conditions are met:
each row has the same number of soldiers,
no row contains a pair of soldiers such that their heights differ by
2
or more.
Calculate the maximum number of soldiers who can participate in the parade.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤10000
) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case begins with a line containing two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤30000
,
1≤k≤
10
12
) — the number of different heights of soldiers and the number of rows of soldiers in the parade, respectively.
The second (and final) line of each test case contains
n
integers
c
1
,
c
2
, ...,
c
n
(
0≤
c
i
≤
10
12
), where
c
i
is the number of soldiers having height
i
in the Berland Army.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
30000
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of soldiers that can participate in the parade.

Note
Explanations for the example test cases:
the heights of soldiers in the rows can be:
[3,3,3,3]
,
[1,2,1,1]
,
[1,1,1,1]
,
[3,3,3,3]
(each list represents a row);
all soldiers can march in the same row;
33
soldiers with height
1
in each of
3
rows;
all soldiers can march in the same row;
all soldiers with height
2
and
3
can march in the same row.
