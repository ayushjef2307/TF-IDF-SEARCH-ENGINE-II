inputstandard input
outputstandard output
The only difference between easy and hard versions is constraints.
You are given
n
segments on the coordinate axis
OX
. Segments can intersect, lie inside each other and even coincide. The
i
-th segment is
[
l
i
;
r
i
]
(
l
i
≤
r
i
) and it covers all integer points
j
such that
l
i
≤j≤
r
i
.
The integer point is called bad if it is covered by strictly more than
k
segments.
Your task is to remove the minimum number of segments so that there are no bad points at all.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤200
) — the number of segments and the maximum number of segments by which each integer point can be covered.
The next
n
lines contain segments. The
i
-th line contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤200
) — the endpoints of the
i
-th segment.
Output
In the first line print one integer
m
(
0≤m≤n
) — the minimum number of segments you need to remove so that there are no bad points.
In the second line print
m
distinct integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
m
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — indices of segments you remove in any order. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
