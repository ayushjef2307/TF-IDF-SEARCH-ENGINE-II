There is a string
s
of lowercase English letters. A cursor is positioned on one of the characters. The cursor can be moved with the following operation: choose a letter
c
and a direction (left or right). The cursor is then moved to the closest occurence of
c
in the chosen direction. If there is no letter
c
in that direction, the cursor stays in place. For example, if
s=abaab
with the cursor on the second character (
a[b]aab
), then:
moving to the closest letter
a
to the left places the cursor on the first character (
[a]baab
);
moving to the closest letter
a
to the right places the cursor the third character (
ab[a]ab
);
moving to the closest letter
b
to the right places the cursor on the fifth character (
abaa[b]
);
any other operation leaves the cursor in place.
Let
dist(i,j)
be the smallest number of operations needed to move the cursor from the
i
-th character to the
j
-th character. Compute

s
of at most
10
