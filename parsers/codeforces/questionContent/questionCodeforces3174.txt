Ujan has finally cleaned up his house and now wants to decorate the interior. He decided to place a beautiful carpet that would really tie the guest room together.
He is interested in carpets that are made up of polygonal patches such that each side of a patch is either a side of another (different) patch, or is an exterior side of the whole carpet. In other words, the carpet can be represented as a planar graph, where each patch corresponds to a face of the graph, each face is a simple polygon. The perimeter of the carpet is the number of the exterior sides.
Ujan considers a carpet beautiful if it consists of
f
patches, where the
i
-th patch has exactly
a
i
sides, and the perimeter is the smallest possible. Find an example of such a carpet, so that Ujan can order it!
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer
f
(
1≤f≤
10
5
), the number of patches in the carpet.
The next line contains
f
integers
a
1
,…,
a
f
(
3≤
a
i
≤3⋅
10
5
), the number of sides of the patches. The total number of the sides of the patches
a
1
+…+
a
f
does not exceed
3⋅
10
5
.
Output
Output the description of the carpet as a graph.
First, output a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤3⋅
10
5
), the total number of vertices in your graph (the vertices must be numbered from
1
to
n
).
Then output
f
lines containing the description of the faces. The
i
-th line should describe the
i
-th face and contain
a
i
distinct integers
v
i,1
,…,
v
i,
a
i
(
1≤
v
i,j
≤n
), which means that the vertices
v
i,j
and
v
i,(jmod
a
i
)+1
are connected by an edge for any
1≤j≤
a
i
.
The graph should be planar and satisfy the restrictions described in the problem statement. Its perimeter should be the smallest possible. There should be no double edges or self-loops in the graph. The graph should be connected. Note that a solution always exists; if there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

Note
In the first sample, the two triangular faces are connected by a single edge, which results in the minimum perimeter
4
.
The figure shows one possible configuration for the second sample. The minimum perimeter in this case is
3
.
