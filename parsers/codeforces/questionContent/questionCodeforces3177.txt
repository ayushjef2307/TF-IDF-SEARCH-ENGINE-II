Ujan has a lot of useless stuff in his drawers, a considerable part of which are his math notebooks: it is time to sort them out. This time he found an old dusty graph theory notebook with a description of a graph.
It is an undirected weighted graph on
n
vertices. It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either
0
or
1
; exactly
m
edges have weight
1
, and all others have weight
0
.
Since Ujan doesn't really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph. (The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all its edges.) Can you find the answer for Ujan so he stops procrastinating?
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤
10
5
,
0≤m≤min(
n(n−1)
2
,
10
5
)
), the number of vertices and the number of edges of weight
1
in the graph.
The
i
-th of the next
m
lines contains two integers
a
i
and
b
i
(
1≤
a
i
,
b
i
≤n
,
a
i
≠
b
i
), the endpoints of the
i
-th edge of weight
1
.
It is guaranteed that no edge appears twice in the input.
Output
Output a single integer, the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.

Note
The graph from the first sample is shown below. Dashed edges have weight
0
, other edges have weight
1
. One of the minimum spanning trees is highlighted in orange and has total weight
2
.
In the second sample, all edges have weight
0
so any spanning tree has total weight
0
.
