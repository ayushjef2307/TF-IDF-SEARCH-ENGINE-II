You are at your grandparents' house and you are playing an old video game on a strange console. Your controller has only two buttons and each button has a number written on it.
Initially, your score is
0
. The game is composed of
n
rounds. For each
1≤i≤n
, the
i
-th round works as follows.
On the screen, a symbol
s
i
appears, which is either
+
(plus) or
-
(minus). Then you must press one of the two buttons on the controller once. Suppose you press a button with the number
x
written on it: your score will increase by
x
if the symbol was
+
and will decrease by
x
if the symbol was
-
. After you press the button, the round ends.
After you have played all
n
rounds, you win if your score is
0
.
Over the years, your grandparents bought many different controllers, so you have
q
of them. The two buttons on the
j
-th controller have the numbers
a
j
and
b
j
written on them. For each controller, you must compute whether you can win the game playing with that controller.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of rounds.
The second line contains a string
s
of length
n
— where
s
i
is the symbol that will appear on the screen in the
i
-th round. It is guaranteed that
s
contains only the characters
+
and
-
.
The third line contains an integer
q
(
1≤q≤
10
5
) — the number of controllers.
The following
q
lines contain two integers
a
j
and
b
j
each (
1≤
a
j
,
b
j
≤
10
9
) — the numbers on the buttons of controller
j
.
Output
Output
q
lines. On line
j
print
YES
if the game is winnable using controller
j
, otherwise print
NO
.

Note
In the first sample, one possible way to get score
0
using the first controller is by pressing the button with numnber
1
in rounds
1
,
2
,
4
,
5
,
6
and
8
, and pressing the button with number
2
in rounds
3
and
7
. It is possible to show that there is no way to get a score of
0
using the second controller.
