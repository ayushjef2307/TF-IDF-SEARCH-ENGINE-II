Another Codeforces Round has just finished! It has gathered
n
participants, and according to the results, the expected rating change of participant
i
is
a
i
. These rating changes are perfectly balanced — their sum is equal to
0
.
Unfortunately, due to minor technical glitches, the round is declared semi-rated. It means that all rating changes must be divided by two.
There are two conditions though:
For each participant
i
, their modified rating change
b
i
must be integer, and as close to
a
i
2
as possible. It means that either
b
i
=⌊
a
i
2
⌋
or
b
i
=⌈
a
i
2
⌉
. In particular, if
a
i
is even,
b
i
=
a
i
2
. Here
⌊x⌋
denotes rounding down to the largest integer not greater than
x
, and
⌈x⌉
denotes rounding up to the smallest integer not smaller than
x
.
The modified rating changes must be perfectly balanced — their sum must be equal to
0
.
Can you help with that?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤13845
), denoting the number of participants.
Each of the next
n
lines contains a single integer
a
i
(
−336≤
a
i
≤1164
), denoting the rating change of the
i
-th participant.
The sum of all
a
i
is equal to
0
.
Output
Output
n
integers
b
i
, each denoting the modified rating change of the
i
-th participant in order of input.
For any
i
, it must be true that either
b
i
=⌊
a
i
2
⌋
or
b
i
=⌈
a
i
2
⌉
. The sum of all
b
i
must be equal to
0
.
If there are multiple solutions, print any. We can show that a solution exists for any valid input.

Note
In the first example,
b

=5
,
b
2
=−3
and
b
3
=−2
is another correct solution.
In the second example there are
6
possible solutions, one of them is shown in the example output.
