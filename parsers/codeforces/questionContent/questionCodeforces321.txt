In a parallel universe there are
n
chemical elements, numbered from
1
to
n
. The element number
n
has not been discovered so far, and its discovery would be a pinnacle of research and would bring the person who does it eternal fame and the so-called SWERC prize.
There are
m
independent researchers, numbered from
1
to
m
, that are trying to discover it. Currently, the
i
-th researcher has a sample of the element
s
i
. Every year, each researcher independently does one fusion experiment. In a fusion experiment, if the researcher currently has a sample of element
a
, they produce a sample of an element
b
that is chosen uniformly at random between
a+1
and
n
, and they lose the sample of element
a
. The elements discovered by different researchers or in different years are completely independent.
The first researcher to discover element
n
will get the SWERC prize. If several researchers discover the element in the same year, they all get the prize. For each
i=1,2,…,m
, you need to compute the probability that the
i
-th researcher wins the prize.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤
10
18
,
1≤m≤100
) — the number of elements and the number of researchers.
The second line contains
m
integers
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
m
(
1≤
s
i
<n
) — the elements that the researchers currently have.
Output
Print
m
floating-point numbers. The
i
-th number should be the probability that the
i
-th researcher wins the SWERC prize. Your answer is accepted if each number differs from the correct number by at most
10
−8
.

Note
In the first sample, all researchers will discover element
2
in the first year and win the SWERC prize.
In the second sample, the last researcher will definitely discover element
3
in the first year and win the SWERC prize. The first two researchers have a
50%
chance of discovering element
2
and a
50%
chance of discovering element
3
, and only element
3
will bring them the prize.
In the third sample, each researcher has an independent
50%
chance of discovering element
3
in the first year, in which case they definitely win the SWERC prize. Additionally, if they all discover element
2
in the first year, which is a
12.5%
chance, then they will all discover element
3
in the second year and all win the prize.
