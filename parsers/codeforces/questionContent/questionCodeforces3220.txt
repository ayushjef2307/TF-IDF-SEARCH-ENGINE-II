You have
n×n
square grid and an integer
k
. Put an integer in each cell while satisfying the conditions below.
All numbers in the grid should be between
1
and
k
inclusive.
Minimum number of the
i
-th row is
1
(
1≤i≤n
).
Minimum number of the
j
-th column is
1
(
1≤j≤n
).
Find the number of ways to put integers in the grid. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo
(
10
9
+7)
.
These are the examples of valid and invalid grid when
n=k=2
.
Input
The only line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤250
,
1≤k≤
10
9
).
Output
Print the answer modulo
(
10
9
+7)
.

cases are possible.
In the second example, make sure you print the answer modulo
