Suppose there is a
h×w
grid consisting of empty or full cells. Let's make some definitions:
r
i
is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the left side in the
i
-th row (
1≤i≤h
). In particular,
r
i
=0
if the leftmost cell of the
i
-th row is empty.
c
j
is the number of consecutive full cells connected to the top end in the
j
-th column (
1≤j≤w
). In particular,
c
j
=0
if the topmost cell of the
j
-th column is empty.
In other words, the
i
-th row starts exactly with
r
i
full cells. Similarly, the
j
-th column starts exactly with
c
j
full cells.
These are the
r
and
c
values of some
3×4
grid. Black cells are full and white cells are empty.
You have values of
r
and
c
. Initially, all cells are empty. Find the number of ways to fill grid cells to satisfy values of
r
and
c
. Since the answer can be very large, find the answer modulo
1000000007(
10
9
+7)
. In other words, find the remainder after division of the answer by
1000000007(
10
9
+7)
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
h
and
w
(
1≤h,w≤
10
3
) — the height and width of the grid.
The second line contains
h
integers
r
1
,
r
2
,…,
r
h
(
0≤
r
i
≤w
) — the values of
r
.
The third line contains
w
integers
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
w
(
0≤
c
j
≤h
) — the values of
c
.
Output

1000000007(
10

Note
In the first example, this is the other possible case.
In the second example, it's impossible to make a grid to satisfy such
r
,
c
values.
In the third example, make sure to print answer modulo

+7)
.
