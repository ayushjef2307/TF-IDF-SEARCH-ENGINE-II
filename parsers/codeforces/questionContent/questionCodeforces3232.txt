Permutation
p
is a sequence of integers
p=[
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
]
, consisting of
n
distinct (unique) positive integers between
1
and
n
, inclusive. For example, the following sequences are permutations:
[3,4,1,2]
,
[1]
,
[1,2]
. The following sequences are not permutations:
[0]
,
[1,2,1]
,
[2,3]
,
[0,1,2]
.
The important key is in the locked box that you need to open. To open the box you need to enter secret code. Secret code is a permutation
p
of length
n
.
You don't know this permutation, you only know the array
q
of prefix maximums of this permutation. Formally:
q
1
=
p
1
,
q
2
=max(
p
1
,
p
2
)
,
q
3
=max(
p
1
,
p
2
,
p
3
)
,
...
q
n
=max(
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
)
.
You want to construct any possible suitable permutation (i.e. any such permutation, that calculated
q
for this permutation is equal to the given array).
Input
The first line contains integer number
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases in the input. Then
t
test cases follow.
The first line of a test case contains one integer
n
(1≤n≤
10
5
)
 — the number of elements in the secret code permutation
p
.
The second line of a test case contains
n
integers
q
1
,
q
2
,…,
q
n
(1≤
q
i
≤n)
 — elements of the array
q
for secret permutation. It is guaranteed that
q
i
≤
q
i+1
for all
i
(
1≤i<n
).
The sum of all values
n
over all the test cases in the input doesn't exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print:
If it's impossible to find such a permutation
p
, print "-1" (without quotes).
Otherwise, print
n
distinct integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
). If there are multiple possible answers, you can print any of them.

Note
In the first test case of the example answer
[1,3,4,5,2]
is the only possible answer:
q
1
=
p
1
=1
;
q
2
=max(
p
1
,
p
2
)=3
;
q
3
=max(
p
1
,
p
2
,
p
3
)=4
;
q
4
=max(
p
1
,
p
2
,
p
3
,
p
4
)=5
;
q
5
=max(
p
1
,
p
2
,
p
3
,
p
4
,
p
5
)=5
.
It can be proved that there are no answers for the second test case of the example.
