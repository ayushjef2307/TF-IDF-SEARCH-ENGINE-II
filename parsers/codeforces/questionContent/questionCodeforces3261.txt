Sasha grew up and went to first grade. To celebrate this event her mother bought her a multiplication table
M
with
n
rows and
n
columns such that
M
ij
=
a
i
⋅
a
j
where
a
1
,…,
a
n
is some sequence of positive integers.
Of course, the girl decided to take it to school with her. But while she was having lunch, hooligan Grisha erased numbers on the main diagonal and threw away the array
a
1
,…,
a
n
. Help Sasha restore the array!
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
3⩽n⩽
10
3
), the size of the table.
The next
n
lines contain
n
integers each. The
j
-th number of the
i
-th line contains the number
M
ij
(
1≤
M
ij
≤
10
9
). The table has zeroes on the main diagonal, that is,
M
ii
=0
.
Output
In a single line print
n
integers, the original array
a
1
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
). It is guaranteed that an answer exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.
