We are definitely not going to bother you with another generic story when Alice finds about an array or when Alice and Bob play some stupid game. This time you'll get a simple, plain text.
First, let us define several things. We define function
F
on the array
A
such that
F(i,1)=A[i]
and
F(i,m)=A[F(i,m−1)]
for
m>1
. In other words, value
F(i,m)
represents composition
A[...A[i]]
applied
m
times.
You are given an array of length
N
with non-negative integers. You are expected to give an answer on
Q
queries. Each query consists of two numbers –
m
and
y
. For each query determine how many
x
exist such that
F(x,m)=y
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
N
(1≤N≤2⋅
10
5
)
– the size of the array
A
. The next line contains
N
non-negative integers – the array
A
itself
(1≤
A
i
≤N)
. The next line contains one integer
Q
(1≤Q≤
10
5
)
– the number of queries. Each of the next
Q
lines contain two integers
m
and
y
(1≤m≤
10
18
,1≤y≤N)
.
Output
Output exactly
Q
lines with a single integer in each that represent the solution. Output the solutions in the order the queries were asked in.

Note
For the first query we can notice that
F(3,10)=1, F(9,10)=1
and
F(10,10)=1
.
For the second query no
x
satisfies condition
F(x,5)=7
.
For the third query
F(5,10)=6
holds.
For the fourth query
F(3,1)=1.
For the fifth query no
x
satisfies condition
F(x,10)=8
.
