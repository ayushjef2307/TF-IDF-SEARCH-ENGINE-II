Three planets
X
,
Y
and
Z
within the Alpha planetary system are inhabited with an advanced civilization. The spaceports of these planets are connected by interplanetary space shuttles. The flight scheduler should decide between
1
,
2
and
3
return flights for every existing space shuttle connection. Since the residents of Alpha are strong opponents of the symmetry, there is a strict rule that any two of the spaceports connected by a shuttle must have a different number of flights.
For every pair of connected spaceports, your goal is to propose a number
1
,
2
or
3
for each shuttle flight, so that for every two connected spaceports the overall number of flights differs.
You may assume that:
1) Every planet has at least one spaceport
2) There exist only shuttle flights between spaceports of different planets
3) For every two spaceports there is a series of shuttle flights enabling traveling between them
4) Spaceports are not connected by more than one shuttle
Input
The first row of the input is the integer number
N
(3≤N≤100000)
, representing overall number of spaceports. The second row is the integer number
M
(2≤M≤100000)
representing number of shuttle flight connections.
Third row contains
N
characters from the set
{X,Y,Z}
. Letter on
I
th
position indicates on which planet is situated spaceport
I
. For example, "XYYXZZ" indicates that the spaceports
0
and
3
are located at planet
X
, spaceports
1
and
2
are located at
Y
, and spaceports
4
and
5
are at
Z
.
Starting from the fourth row, every row contains two integer numbers separated by a whitespace. These numbers are natural numbers smaller than
N
and indicate the numbers of the spaceports that are connected. For example, "
12 15
" indicates that there is a shuttle flight between spaceports
12
and
15
.
Output
The same representation of shuttle flights in separate rows as in the input, but also containing a third number from the set
{1,2,3}
standing for the number of shuttle flights between these spaceports.
