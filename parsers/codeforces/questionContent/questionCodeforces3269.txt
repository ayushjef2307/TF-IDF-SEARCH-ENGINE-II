While roaming the mystic areas of Stonefalls, in order to drop legendary loot, an adventurer was given a quest as follows. He was given an array
A=
a
1
,
a
2
,...,
a
N
of length
N
, and a number
K
.
Define array
B
as
B(q,A)=
{
q−
a
1
,q−
a
2
,...,q−
a
N
}. Define function
F
as
F(B,K)
being sum of products of all
K
-tuples of elements in array
B
. For example, if the array
B
is
[2,3,4,5]
, and with
K=3
, sum of products of all 3-tuples is
F(B,3)=2∗3∗4+2∗3∗5+3∗4∗5+2∗4∗5

He was then given a number Q, number of queries of two types:
Type 1: Given
q
,
i
, and
d
calculate
F(B(q,A),K)
where we make change to initial array as
A[i]=d
.
Type 2: Given
q
,
L
,
R
, and
d
calculate
F(B(q,A),K)
where we make change to initial array as
A[i]=A[i]+d
for all
i
in range
[L,R]
inclusive.
All changes are temporarily made to initial array, and don't propagate to following queries. Help the adventurer calculate the answer to a quest, and finally get that loot!
Input
In the first two lines, numbers
N
(
1≤N≤2∗
10
4
) and
K
(
1≤K≤N
), the length of initial array
A
, and tuple size, followed by
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
,…,
a
N
(
0≤
a
i
≤

) , elements of array
A
, in the next line. Then follows number
Q
(
Q≤10
), number of queries. In the next
Q
lines come queries of the form:
1 q i d, for type 1,
2 q L R d, for type 2,
as explained above (
0≤q,d≤

)
Output
Print
Q
lines, the answers to queries, modulo
998244353

Note
In the first query array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], B = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], sum of products of 2-tuples = 85.
In second query array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2], B = [5, 4, 3, 2, 4], sum of products of 2-tuples = 127
In third query array A = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5], B = [5, 3, 2, 2, 1], sum of products of 2-tuples = 63
