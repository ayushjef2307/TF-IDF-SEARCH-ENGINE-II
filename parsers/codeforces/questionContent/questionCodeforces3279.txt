You work as a system administrator in a dormitory, which has
n
rooms one after another along a straight hallway. Rooms are numbered from
1
to
n
.
You have to connect all
n
rooms to the Internet.
You can connect each room to the Internet directly, the cost of such connection for the
i
-th room is
i
coins.
Some rooms also have a spot for a router. The cost of placing a router in the
i
-th room is also
i
coins. You cannot place a router in a room which does not have a spot for it. When you place a router in the room
i
, you connect all rooms with the numbers from
max(1, i−k)
to
min(n, i+k)
inclusive to the Internet, where
k
is the range of router. The value of
k
is the same for all routers.
Calculate the minimum total cost of connecting all
n
rooms to the Internet. You can assume that the number of rooms which have a spot for a router is not greater than the number of routers you have.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n,k≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of rooms and the range of each router.
The second line of the input contains one string
s
of length
n
, consisting only of zeros and ones. If the
i
-th character of the string equals to '1' then there is a spot for a router in the
i
-th room. If the
i
-th character of the string equals to '0' then you cannot place a router in the
i
-th room.
Output
Print one integer — the minimum total cost of connecting all
n
rooms to the Internet.

Note
In the first example it is enough to place the router in the room
3
, then all rooms will be connected to the Internet. The total cost of connection is
3
.
In the second example you can place routers nowhere, so you need to connect all rooms directly. Thus, the total cost of connection of all rooms is
1+2+3+4+5+6=21
.
In the third example you need to connect the room
1
directly and place the router in the room
3
. Thus, the total cost of connection of all rooms is
1+3=4
.
In the fourth example you need to place routers in rooms
5
and
10
. Then all rooms will be connected to the Internet. The total cost of connection is
5+10=15
.
