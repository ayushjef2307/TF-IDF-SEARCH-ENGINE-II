The only difference between the easy and the hard versions is the maximum value of
k
.
You are given an infinite sequence of form "112123123412345
…
" which consist of blocks of all consecutive positive integers written one after another. The first block consists of all numbers from
1
to
1
, the second one — from
1
to
2
, the third one — from
1
to
3
,
…
, the
i
-th block consists of all numbers from
1
to
i
.
So the first
56
elements of the sequence are "11212312341234512345612345671234567812345678912345678910". Elements of the sequence are numbered from one. For example, the
1
-st element of the sequence is
1
, the
3
-rd element of the sequence is
2
, the
20
-th element of the sequence is
5
, the
38
-th element is
2
, the
56
-th element of the sequence is
0
.
Your task is to answer
q
independent queries. In the
i
-th query you are given one integer
k
i
. Calculate the digit at the position
k
i
of the sequence.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤500
) — the number of queries.
The
i
-th of the following
q
lines contains one integer
k
i
(1≤
k
i
≤
10
9
)
— the description of the corresponding query.
Output
Print
q
lines. In the
i
-th line print one digit
x
i
(0≤
x
i
≤9)
— the answer to the query
i
, i.e.
x
i
should be equal to the element at the position
k
i
of the sequence.
