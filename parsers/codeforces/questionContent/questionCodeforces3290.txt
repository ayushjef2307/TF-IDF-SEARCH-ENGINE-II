You are given a sequence
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
consisting of
n
non-zero integers (i.e.
a
i
≠0
).
You have to calculate two following values:
the number of pairs of indices
(l,r)
(l≤r)
such that
a
l
⋅
a
l+1
…
a
r−1
⋅
a
r
is negative;
the number of pairs of indices
(l,r)
(l≤r)
such that
a
l
⋅
a
l+1
…
a
r−1
⋅
a
r
is positive;
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(1≤n≤2⋅
10

)
— the number of elements in the sequence.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a

,…,
a
n
(−

— the elements of the sequence.
Output
Print two integers — the number of subsegments with negative product and the number of subsegments with positive product, respectively.
