Authors have come up with the string
s
consisting of
n
lowercase Latin letters.
You are given two permutations of its indices (not necessary equal)
p
and
q
(both of length
n
). Recall that the permutation is the array of length
n
which contains each integer from
1
to
n
exactly once.
For all
i
from
1
to
n−1
the following properties hold:
s[
p
i
]≤s[
p
i+1
]
and
s[
q
i
]≤s[
q
i+1
]
. It means that if you will write down all characters of
s
in order of permutation indices, the resulting string will be sorted in the non-decreasing order.
Your task is to restore any such string
s
of length
n
consisting of at least
k
distinct lowercase Latin letters which suits the given permutations.
If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,1≤k≤26
) — the length of the string and the number of distinct characters required.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
, all
p
i
are distinct integers from
1
to
n
) — the permutation
p
.
The third line of the input contains
n
integers
q
1
,
q
2
,…,
q
n
(
1≤
q
i
≤n
, all
q
i
are distinct integers from
1
to
n
) — the permutation
q
.
Output
If it is impossible to find the suitable string, print "NO" on the first line.
Otherwise print "YES" on the first line and string
s
on the second line. It should consist of
n
lowercase Latin letters, contain at least
k
distinct characters and suit the given permutations.
If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
