Polycarp is reading a book consisting of
n
pages numbered from
1
to
n
. Every time he finishes the page with the number divisible by
m
, he writes down the last digit of this page number. For example, if
n=15
and
m=5
, pages divisible by
m
are
5,10,15
. Their last digits are
5,0,5
correspondingly, their sum is
10
.
Your task is to calculate the sum of all digits Polycarp has written down.
You have to answer
q
independent queries.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤1000
) — the number of queries.
The following
q
lines contain queries, one per line. Each query is given as two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤
10
16
) — the number of pages in the book and required divisor, respectively.
Output
For each query print the answer for it — the sum of digits written down by Polycarp.
