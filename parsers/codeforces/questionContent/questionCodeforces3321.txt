Konrad is a Human Relations consultant working for VoltModder, a large electrical equipment producer. Today, he has been tasked with evaluating the level of happiness in the company.
There are
n
people working for VoltModder, numbered from
1
to
n
. Each employee earns a different amount of money in the company — initially, the
i
-th person earns
i
rubles per day.
On each of
q
following days, the salaries will be revised. At the end of the
i
-th day, employee
v
i
will start earning
n+i
rubles per day and will become the best-paid person in the company. The employee will keep his new salary until it gets revised again.
Some pairs of people don't like each other. This creates a great psychological danger in the company. Formally, if two people
a
and
b
dislike each other and
a
earns more money than
b
, employee
a
will brag about this to
b
. A dangerous triple is a triple of three employees
a
,
b
and
c
, such that
a
brags to
b
, who in turn brags to
c
. If
a
dislikes
b
, then
b
dislikes
a
.
At the beginning of each day, Konrad needs to evaluate the number of dangerous triples in the company. Can you help him do it?
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤100000
,
0≤m≤100000
) — the number of employees in the company and the number of pairs of people who don't like each other. Each of the following
m
lines contains two integers
a
i
,
b
i
(
1≤
a
i
,
b
i
≤n
,
a
i
≠
b
i
) denoting that employees
a
i
and
b
i
hate each other (that is,
a
i
dislikes
b
i
and
b
i
dislikes
a
i
). Each such relationship will be mentioned exactly once.
The next line contains an integer
q
(
0≤q≤100000
) — the number of salary revisions. The
i
-th of the following
q
lines contains a single integer
v
i
(
1≤
v
i
≤n
) denoting that at the end of the
i
-th day, employee
v
i
will earn the most.
Output
Output
q+1
integers. The
i
-th of them should contain the number of dangerous triples in the company at the beginning of the
i
-th day.

Consider the first sample test. The
i
-th row in the following image shows the structure of the company at the beginning of the
i
-th day. A directed edge from
a
to
b
denotes that employee
a
brags to employee
b
. The dangerous triples are marked by highlighted edges.
