Kamil likes streaming the competitive programming videos. His MeTube channel has recently reached
100
million subscribers. In order to celebrate this, he posted a video with an interesting problem he couldn't solve yet. Can you help him?
You're given a tree — a connected undirected graph consisting of
n
vertices connected by
n−1
edges. The tree is rooted at vertex
1
. A vertex
u
is called an ancestor of
v
if it lies on the shortest path between the root and
v
. In particular, a vertex is an ancestor of itself.
Each vertex
v
is assigned its beauty
x
v
— a non-negative integer not larger than
10
12
. This allows us to define the beauty of a path. Let
u
be an ancestor of
v
. Then we define the beauty
f(u,v)
as the greatest common divisor of the beauties of all vertices on the shortest path between
u
and
v
. Formally, if
u=
t
1
,
t
2
,
t
3
,…,
t
k
=v
are the vertices on the shortest path between
u
and
v
, then
f(u,v)=gcd(
x
t
1
,
x
t
2
,…,
x
t
k
)
. Here,
gcd
denotes the greatest common divisor of a set of numbers. In particular,
f(u,u)=gcd(
x
u
)=
x
u
.
Your task is to find the sum
∑
u is an ancestor of v
f(u,v).
∑
f
(
)
As the result might be too large, please output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Note that for each
y
,
gcd(0,y)=gcd(y,0)=y
. In particular,
gcd(0,0)=0
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤100000
) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The following line contains
n
integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
(
0≤
x
i
≤
10
12
). The value
x
v
denotes the beauty of vertex
v
.
The following
n−1
lines describe the edges of the tree. Each of them contains two integers
a,b
(
1≤a,b≤n
,
a≠b
) — the vertices connected by a single edge.
Output
Output the sum of the beauties on all paths
(u,v)
such that
u
is ancestor of
v
. This sum should be printed modulo
10
9
+7
.
