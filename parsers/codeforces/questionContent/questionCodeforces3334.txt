You are given a sequence of integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. You need to paint elements in colors, so that:
If we consider any color, all elements of this color must be divisible by the minimal element of this color.
The number of used colors must be minimized.
For example, it's fine to paint elements
[40,10,60]
in a single color, because they are all divisible by
10
. You can use any color an arbitrary amount of times (in particular, it is allowed to use a color only once). The elements painted in one color do not need to be consecutive.
For example, if
a=[6,2,3,4,12]
then two colors are required: let's paint
6
,
3
and
12
in the first color (
6
,
3
and
12
are divisible by
3
) and paint
2
and
4
in the second color (
2
and
4
are divisible by
2
). For example, if
a=[10,7,15]
then
3
colors are required (we can simply paint each element in an unique color).
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
), where
n
is the length of the given sequence.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤100
). These numbers can contain duplicates.
Output
Print the minimal number of colors to paint all the given numbers in a valid way.

Note
In the first example, one possible way to paint the elements in
3
colors is:
paint in the first color the elements:
a
1
=10
and
a
4
=5
,
paint in the second color the element
a
3
=3
,
paint in the third color the elements:
a
2
=2
,
a
5
=4
and
a
6
=2
.
In the second example, you can use one color to paint all the elements.
In the third example, one possible way to paint the elements in
4
colors is:
paint in the first color the elements:
a
4
=4
,
a
6
=2
and
a
7
=2
,
paint in the second color the elements:
a
2
=6
,
a
5
=3
and
a
8
=3
,
paint in the third color the element
a
3
=5
,
paint in the fourth color the element
a
1
=7
.
