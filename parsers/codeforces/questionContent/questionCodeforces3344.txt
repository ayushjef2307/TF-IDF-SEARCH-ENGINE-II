This is an interactive problem. Remember to flush your output while communicating with the testing program. You may use fflush(stdout) in C++, system.out.flush() in Java, stdout.flush() in Python or flush(output) in Pascal to flush the output. If you use some other programming language, consult its documentation. You may also refer to the guide on interactive problems: https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/45307.
The jury picked an integer
x
not less than
0
and not greater than
214−1
. You have to guess this integer.
To do so, you may ask no more than
2
queries. Each query should consist of
100
integer numbers
a1
,
a2
, ...,
a100
(each integer should be not less than
0
and not greater than
214−1
). In response to your query, the jury will pick one integer
i
(
1≤i≤100
) and tell you the value of
ai⊕x
(the bitwise XOR of
ai
and
x
). There is an additional constraint on the queries: all
200
integers you use in the queries should be distinct.
It is guaranteed that the value of
x
is fixed beforehand in each test, but the choice of
i
in every query may depend on the integers you send.
Output
To give the answer, your program should print one line
!
x
with a line break in the end. After that, it should flush the output and terminate gracefully.
Interaction
Before giving the answer, you may submit no more than
2
queries. To ask a query, print one line in the following format:
?
a1
a2
...
a100
, where every
aj
should be an integer from the range
[0,214−1]
. The line should be ended with a line break character. After submitting a query, flush the output and read the answer to your query — the value of
ai⊕x
for some
i∈[1,100]
. No integer can be used in queries more than once.
If you submit an incorrect query (or ask more than
2
queries), the answer to it will be one integer
−1
. After receiving such an answer, your program should terminate immediately — otherwise you may receive verdict "Runtime error", "Time limit exceeded" or some other verdict instead of "Wrong answer".

? 32 24 37
! 5
Note
The example of interaction is not correct — you should sumbit exactly
100
integers in each query. Everything else is correct.
