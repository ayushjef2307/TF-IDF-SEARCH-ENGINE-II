You are given a sequence of
n
pairs of integers:
(
a
1
,
b
1
),(
a
2
,
b
2
),…,(
a
n
,
b
n
)
. This sequence is called bad if it is sorted in non-descending order by first elements or if it is sorted in non-descending order by second elements. Otherwise the sequence is good. There are examples of good and bad sequences:
s=[(1,2),(3,2),(3,1)]
is bad because the sequence of first elements is sorted:
[1,3,3]
;
s=[(1,2),(3,2),(1,2)]
is bad because the sequence of second elements is sorted:
[2,2,2]
;
s=[(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)]
is bad because both sequences (the sequence of first elements and the sequence of second elements) are sorted;
s=[(1,3),(3,3),(2,2)]
is good because neither the sequence of first elements
([1,3,2])
nor the sequence of second elements
([3,3,2])
is sorted.
Calculate the number of permutations of size
n
such that after applying this permutation to the sequence
s
it turns into a good sequence.
A permutation
p
of size
n
is a sequence
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
). If you apply permutation
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
to the sequence
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
n
you get the sequence
s
p
1
,
s
p
2
,…,
s
p
n
. For example, if
s=[(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)]
and
p=[2,3,1]
then
s
turns into
[(1,3),(2,3),(1,2)]
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤3⋅
10
5
).
The next
n
lines contains description of sequence
s
. The
i
-th line contains two integers
a
i
and
b
i
(
1≤
a
i
,
b
i
≤n
) — the first and second elements of
i
-th pair in the sequence.
The sequence
s
may contain equal elements.
Output
Print the number of permutations of size
n
such that after applying this permutation to the sequence
s
it turns into a good sequence. Print the answer modulo
998244353
(a prime number).

Note
In first test case there are six permutations of size
3
:
if
p=[1,2,3]
, then
s=[(1,1),(2,2),(3,1)]
— bad sequence (sorted by first elements);
if
p=[1,3,2]
, then
s=[(1,1),(3,1),(2,2)]
— bad sequence (sorted by second elements);
if
p=[2,1,3]
, then
s=[(2,2),(1,1),(3,1)]
— good sequence;
if
p=[2,3,1]
, then
s=[(2,2),(3,1),(1,1)]
— good sequence;
if
p=[3,1,2]
, then
s=[(3,1),(1,1),(2,2)]
— bad sequence (sorted by second elements);
if
p=[3,2,1]
, then
s=[(3,1),(2,2),(1,1)]
— good sequence.
