Petya and his friend, robot Petya++, like to solve exciting math problems.
One day Petya++ came up with the numbers
n
and
x
and wrote the following equality on the board:
n & (n+1) & … & m=x,
&
(
1
)
&
&
where
&
denotes the bitwise AND operation. Then he suggested his friend Petya find such a minimal
m
(
m≥n
) that the equality on the board holds.
Unfortunately, Petya couldn't solve this problem in his head and decided to ask for computer help. He quickly wrote a program and found the answer.
Can you solve this difficult problem?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤2000
). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
n
,
x
(
0≤n,x≤
10
18
).
Output
For every test case, output the smallest possible value of
m
such that equality holds.
If the equality does not hold for any
m
, print
−1
instead.
We can show that if the required
m
exists, it does not exceed
5⋅
10
18
.

Note
In the first example,
10 & 11=10
, but
10 & 11 & 12=8
, so the answer is
12
.
In the second example,
10=10
, so the answer is
10
.
In the third example, we can see that the required
m
does not exist, so we have to print
−1
.
