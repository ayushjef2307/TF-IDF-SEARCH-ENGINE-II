You are given an array
A
, consisting of
n
positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
, and an array
B
, consisting of
m
positive integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
m
.
Choose some element
a
of
A
and some element
b
of
B
such that
a+b
doesn't belong to
A
and doesn't belong to
B
.
For example, if
A=[2,1,7]
and
B=[1,3,4]
, we can choose
1
from
A
and
4
from
B
, as number
5=1+4
doesn't belong to
A
and doesn't belong to
B
. However, we can't choose
2
from
A
and
1
from
B
, as
3=2+1
belongs to
B
.
It can be shown that such a pair exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.
Choose and print any such two numbers.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the number of elements of
A
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤200
) — the elements of
A
.
The third line contains one integer
m
(
1≤m≤100
) — the number of elements of
B
.
The fourth line contains
m
different integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
m
(
1≤
b
i
≤200
) — the elements of
B
.
It can be shown that the answer always exists.
Output
Output two numbers
a
and
b
such that
a
belongs to
A
,
b
belongs to
B
, but
a+b
doesn't belong to nor
A
neither
B
.
If there are multiple answers, print any.

Note
In the first example, we can choose
20
from array
[20]
and
20
from array
[10,20]
. Number
40=20+20
doesn't belong to any of those arrays. However, it is possible to choose
10
from the second array too.
In the second example, we can choose
3
from array
[3,2,2]
and
1
from array
[1,5,7,7,9]
. Number
4=3+1
doesn't belong to any of those arrays.
In the third example, we can choose
1
from array
[1,3,5,7]
and
1
from array
[7,5,3,1]
. Number
2=1+1
doesn't belong to any of those arrays.
