You are given integers
n
,
k
. Let's consider the alphabet consisting of
k
different elements.
Let beauty
f(s)
of the string
s
be the number of indexes
i
,
1≤i<|s|
, for which prefix of
s
of length
i
equals to suffix of
s
of length
i
. For example, beauty of the string
abacaba
equals
2
, as for
i=1,3
prefix and suffix of length
i
are equal.
Consider all words of length
n
in the given alphabet. Find the expected value of
f(s
)
2
of a uniformly chosen at random word. We can show that it can be expressed as
P
Q
, where
P
and
Q
are coprime and
Q
isn't divided by
10
9
+7
. Output
P⋅
Q

Input
The first and the only line contains two integers
n
,
k
(
1≤n≤
10
5
,
1≤k≤
10

) — the length of a string and the size of alphabet respectively.
Output
Output a single integer —
P×

Note
In the first example, there are
9
words of length
2
in alphabet of size
3
 —
aa
,
ab
,
ac
,
ba
,
bb
,
bc
,
ca
,
cb
,
cc
.
3
of them have beauty
1
and
6
of them have beauty
0
, so the average value is
1
3
.
In the third example, there is only one such word, and it has beauty
99
, so the average value is
99
2
.
