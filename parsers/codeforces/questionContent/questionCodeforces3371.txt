You are given
a
uppercase Latin letters 'A' and
b
letters 'B'.
The period of the string is the smallest such positive integer
k
that
s
i
=
s
i mod k
(
0
-indexed) for each
i
. Note that this implies that
k
won't always divide
a+b=|s|
.
For example, the period of string "ABAABAA" is
3
, the period of "AAAA" is
1
, and the period of "AABBB" is
5
.
Find the number of different periods over all possible strings with
a
letters 'A' and
b
letters 'B'.
Input
The first line contains two integers
a
and
b
(
1≤a,b≤
10
9
) — the number of letters 'A' and 'B', respectively.
Output
Print the number of different periods over all possible strings with
a
letters 'A' and
b
letters 'B'.
