The subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
You are given an integer
n
.
You have to find a sequence
s
consisting of digits
{1,3,7}
such that it has exactly
n
subsequences equal to
1337
.
For example, sequence
337133377
has
6
subsequences equal to
1337
:

Note that the length of the sequence
s
must not exceed
10
5
.
You have to answer
t
independent queries.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤10
) — the number of queries.
Next
t
lines contains a description of queries: the
i
-th line contains one integer
n
i
(
1≤
n
i
≤
10

).
Output
For the
i
-th query print one string
s
i
(
1≤|
s
i

) consisting of digits
{1,3,7}
. String
s
i
must have exactly
n
i
subsequences
1337
. If there are multiple such strings, print any of them.
