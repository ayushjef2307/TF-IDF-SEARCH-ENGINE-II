You have a string
s
— a sequence of commands for your toy robot. The robot is placed in some cell of a rectangular grid. He can perform four commands:
'W' — move one cell up;
'S' — move one cell down;
'A' — move one cell left;
'D' — move one cell right.
Let
Grid(s)
be the grid of minimum possible area such that there is a position in the grid where you can place the robot in such a way that it will not fall from the grid while running the sequence of commands
s
. For example, if
s=DSAWWAW
then
Grid(s)
is the
4×3
grid:
you can place the robot in the cell
(3,2)
;
the robot performs the command 'D' and moves to
(3,3)
;
the robot performs the command 'S' and moves to
(4,3)
;
the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to
(4,2)
;
the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to
(3,2)
;
the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to
(2,2)
;
the robot performs the command 'A' and moves to
(2,1)
;
the robot performs the command 'W' and moves to
(1,1)
.
You have
4
extra letters: one 'W', one 'A', one 'S', one 'D'. You'd like to insert at most one of these letters in any position of sequence
s
to minimize the area of
Grid(s)
.
What is the minimum area of
Grid(s)
you can achieve?
Input
The first line contains one integer
T
(
1≤T≤1000
) — the number of queries.
Next
T
lines contain queries: one per line. This line contains single string
s
(
1≤|s|≤2⋅
10
5
,
s
i
∈{W,A,S,D}
) — the sequence of commands.
It's guaranteed that the total length of
s
over all queries doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
Print
T
integers: one per query. For each query print the minimum area of
Grid(s)
you can achieve.

Note
In the first query you have to get string

.
In second and third queries you can not decrease the area of
Grid(s)
.
