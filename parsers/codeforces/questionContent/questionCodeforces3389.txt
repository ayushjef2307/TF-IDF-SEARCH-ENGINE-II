While sailing on a boat, Inessa noticed a beautiful water lily flower above the lake's surface. She came closer and it turned out that the lily was exactly
H
centimeters above the water surface. Inessa grabbed the flower and sailed the distance of
L
centimeters. Exactly at this point the flower touched the water surface.
Suppose that the lily grows at some point
A
on the lake bottom, and its stem is always a straight segment with one endpoint at point
A
. Also suppose that initially the flower was exactly above the point
A
, i.e. its stem was vertical. Can you determine the depth of the lake at point
A
?
Input
The only line contains two integers
H
and
L
(
1≤H<L≤
10
6
).
Output
Print a single number — the depth of the lake at point
A
. The absolute or relative error should not exceed
10
−6
.
Formally, let your answer be
A
, and the jury's answer be
B
. Your answer is accepted if and only if
|A−B|
max(1,|B|)
≤
10
−6
.
