ChthollyNotaSeniorious gives DataStructures a number axis with
m
distinct segments on it. Let
f(l,r)
be the number of ways to choose an even number of segments such that the union of them is exactly
[l,r]
, and
g(l,r)
be the number of ways to choose an odd number of segments such that the union of them is exactly
[l,r]
.
ChthollyNotaSeniorious asked DataStructures
q
questions. In each query, ChthollyNotaSeniorious will give DataStructures two numbers
l,r
, and now he wishes that you can help him find the value
f(l,r)−g(l,r)
modulo
998244353
so that he wouldn't let her down.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers
m
(
1≤m≤2⋅
10
5
) and
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅
10
5
)  — the number of segments and queries, correspondingly.
The
i
-th of the next
m
lines contains two integers
x
i
and
y
i
(
1≤
x
i
<
y
i
≤
10
9
), denoting a segment
[
x
i
,
y
i
]
.
It is guaranteed that all segments are distinct. More formally, there do not exist two numbers
i,j
with
1≤i<j≤m
such that
x
i
=
x
j
and
y
i
=
y
j
.
The
i
-th of the next
q
lines contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
<
r
i
≤
10
9
), describing a query.
Output
For each query, output a single integer  —
f(
l
i
,
r
i
)−g(
l
i
,
r
i
)
modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first query, we have to find
f(1,4)−g(1,4)
. The only subset of segments with union
[1,4]
is
{[1,3],[2,4]}
, so
f(1,4)=1,g(1,4)=0
.
In the second query, we have to find
f(1,5)−g(1,5)
. The only subsets of segments with union
[1,5]
are
{[1,3],[2,4],[3,5]}
and
{[1,3],[3,5]}
, so
f(1,5)=1,g(1,5)=1
.
