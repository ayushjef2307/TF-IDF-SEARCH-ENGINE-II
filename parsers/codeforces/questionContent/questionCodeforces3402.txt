Let's denote a
k
-step ladder as the following structure: exactly
k+2
wooden planks, of which
two planks of length at least
k+1
— the base of the ladder;
k
planks of length at least
1
— the steps of the ladder;
Note that neither the base planks, nor the steps planks are required to be equal.
For example, ladders
1
and
3
are correct
2
-step ladders and ladder
2
is a correct
1
-step ladder. On the first picture the lengths of planks are
[3,3]
for the base and
[1]
for the step. On the second picture lengths are
[3,3]
for the base and
[2]
for the step. On the third picture lengths are
[3,4]
for the base and
[2,3]
for the steps.
You have
n
planks. The length of the
i
-th planks is
a
i
. You don't have a saw, so you can't cut the planks you have. Though you have a hammer and nails, so you can assemble the improvised "ladder" from the planks.
The question is: what is the maximum number
k
such that you can choose some subset of the given planks and assemble a
k
-step ladder using them?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
T
(
1≤T≤100
) — the number of queries. The queries are independent.
Each query consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of planks you have.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
5
) — the lengths of the corresponding planks.
It's guaranteed that the total number of planks from all queries doesn't exceed
10
5
.
Output
Print
T
integers — one per query. The
i
-th integer is the maximum number
k
, such that you can choose some subset of the planks given in the
i
-th query and assemble a
k
-step ladder using them.
Print
0
if you can't make even
1
-step ladder from the given set of planks.
