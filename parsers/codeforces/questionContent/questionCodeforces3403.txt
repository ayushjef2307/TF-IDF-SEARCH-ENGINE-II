You are given a connected undirected weighted graph consisting of
n
vertices and
m
edges.
You need to print the
k
-th smallest shortest path in this graph (paths from the vertex to itself are not counted, paths from
i
to
j
and from
j
to
i
are counted as one).
More formally, if
d
is the matrix of shortest paths, where
d
i,j
is the length of the shortest path between vertices
i
and
j
(
1≤i<j≤n
), then you need to print the
k
-th element in the sorted array consisting of all
d
i,j
, where
1≤i<j≤n
.
Input
The first line of the input contains three integers
n,m
and
k
(
2≤n≤2⋅

5
,
n−1≤m≤min(
n(n−1)

)
,
1≤k≤min(
n(n−1)

,400)
 — the number of vertices in the graph, the number of edges in the graph and the value of
k
, correspondingly.
Then
m
lines follow, each containing three integers
x
,
y
and
w
(
1≤x,y≤n
,
1≤w≤
10
9
,
x≠y
) denoting an edge between vertices
x
and
y
of weight
w
.
It is guaranteed that the given graph is connected (there is a path between any pair of vertices), there are no self-loops (edges connecting the vertex with itself) and multiple edges (for each pair of vertices
x
and
y
, there is at most one edge between this pair of vertices in the graph).
Output
Print one integer — the length of the
k
-th smallest shortest path in the given graph (paths from the vertex to itself are not counted, paths from
i
to
j
and from
j
to
i
are counted as one).
