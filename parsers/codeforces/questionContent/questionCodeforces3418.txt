Today Adilbek is taking his probability theory test. Unfortunately, when Adilbek arrived at the university, there had already been a long queue of students wanting to take the same test. Adilbek has estimated that he will be able to start the test only
T
seconds after coming.
Fortunately, Adilbek can spend time without revising any boring theorems or formulas. He has an app on this smartphone which contains
n
Japanese crosswords to solve. Adilbek has decided to solve them all one by one in the order they are listed in the app, without skipping any crossword. For each crossword, a number
t
i
is given that represents the time it takes an average crossword expert to solve this crossword (the time is given in seconds).
Adilbek is a true crossword expert, but, unfortunately, he is sometimes unlucky in choosing the way to solve the crossword. So, it takes him either
t
i
seconds or
t
i
+1
seconds to solve the
i
-th crossword, equiprobably (with probability
1
2
he solves the crossword in exactly
t
i
seconds, and with probability
1
2
he has to spend an additional second to finish the crossword). All these events are independent.
After
T
seconds pass (or after solving the last crossword, if he manages to do it in less than
T
seconds), Adilbek closes the app (if he finishes some crossword at the same moment, that crossword is considered solved; otherwise Adilbek does not finish solving the current crossword at all). He thinks it would be an interesting probability theory problem to calculate
E
— the expected number of crosswords he will be able to solve completely. Can you calculate it?
Recall that the expected value of a discrete random variable is the probability-weighted average of all possible values — in this problem it means that the expected value of the number of solved crosswords can be calculated as
E=
∑
i=0
n
i
p
i
, where
p
i
is the probability that Adilbek will solve exactly
i
crosswords.
We can represent
E
as rational fraction
P
Q
with
Q>0
. To give the answer, you should print
P⋅
Q
−1
mod(

.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
T
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤T≤2⋅
10
14
) — the number of crosswords and the time Adilbek has to spend, respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
t
1
,
t
2
,…,
t
n
(
1≤
t
i
≤
10
9
), where
t
i
is the time it takes a crossword expert to solve the
i
-th crossword.
Note that Adilbek solves the crosswords in the order they are given in the input without skipping any of them.
Output
Print one integer — the expected value of the number of crosswords Adilbek solves in
T
seconds, expressed in the form of
