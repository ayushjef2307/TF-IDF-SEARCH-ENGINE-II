There are
n
segments drawn on a plane; the
i
-th segment connects two points (
x
i,1
,
y
i,1
) and (
x
i,2
,
y
i,2
). Each segment is non-degenerate, and is either horizontal or vertical — formally, for every
i∈[1,n]
either
x
i,1
=
x
i,2
or
y
i,1
=
y
i,2
(but only one of these conditions holds). Only segments of different types may intersect: no pair of horizontal segments shares any common points, and no pair of vertical segments shares any common points.
We say that four segments having indices
h
1
,
h
2
,
v
1
and
v
2
such that
h
1
<
h
2
and
v
1
<
v
2
form a rectangle if the following conditions hold:
segments
h
1
and
h
2
are horizontal;
segments
v
1
and
v
2
are vertical;
segment
h
1
intersects with segment
v
1
;
segment
h
2
intersects with segment
v
1
;
segment
h
1
intersects with segment
v
2
;
segment
h
2
intersects with segment
v
2
.
Please calculate the number of ways to choose four segments so they form a rectangle. Note that the conditions
h
1
<
h
2
and
v
1
<
v
2
should hold.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤5000
) — the number of segments.
Then
n
lines follow. The
i
-th line contains four integers
x
i,1
,
y
i,1
,
x
i,2
and
y
i,2
denoting the endpoints of the
i
-th segment. All coordinates of the endpoints are in the range
[−5000,5000]
.
It is guaranteed that each segment is non-degenerate and is either horizontal or vertical. Furthermore, if two segments share a common point, one of these segments is horizontal, and another one is vertical.
Output
Print one integer — the number of ways to choose four segments so they form a rectangle.
