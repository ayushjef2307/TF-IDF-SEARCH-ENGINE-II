Let's call beauty of an array

You're given an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…
a
n
and a number
k
. Calculate the sum of beauty over all subsequences of the array of length exactly
k
. As this number can be very large, output it modulo
998244353
.
A sequence
a
is a subsequence of an array
b
if
a
can be obtained from
b
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.
Input
The first line contains integers
n,k
(
2≤k≤n≤1000
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
5
).
Output
Output one integer — the sum of beauty over all subsequences of the array of length exactly
k
. As this number can be very large, output it modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first example, there are
4
subsequences of length
3
 —
[1,7,3]
,
[1,3,5]
,
[7,3,5]
,
[1,7,5]
, each of which has beauty
2
, so answer is
8
.
In the second example, there is only one subsequence of length
5
 — the whole array, which has the beauty equal to
|10−1|=9
.
