Vasya has an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
.
You don't know this array, but he told you
m
facts about this array. The
i
-th fact is a triple of numbers
t
i
,
l
i
and
r
i
(
0≤
t
i
≤1,1≤
l
i
<
r
i
≤n
) and it means:
if
t
i
=1
then subbarray
a
l
i
,
a
l
i
+1
,…,
a
r
i
is sorted in non-decreasing order;
if
t
i
=0
then subbarray
a
l
i
,
a
l
i
+1
,…,
a
r
i
is not sorted in non-decreasing order. A subarray is not sorted if there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in this subarray such that the former is greater than the latter.
For example if
a=[2,1,1,3,2]
then he could give you three facts:
t
1
=1,
l
1
=2,
r
1
=4
(the subarray
[
a
2
,
a
3
,
a
4
]=[1,1,3]
is sorted),
t
2
=0,
l
2
=4,
r
2
=5
(the subarray
[
a
4
,
a
5
]=[3,2]
is not sorted), and
t
3
=0,
l
3
=3,
r
3
=5
(the subarray
[
a
3
,
a
5
]=[1,3,2]
is not sorted).
You don't know the array
a
. Find any array which satisfies all the given facts.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤1000,1≤m≤1000
).
Each of the next
m
lines contains three integers
t
i
,
l
i
and
r
i
(
0≤
t
i
≤1,1≤
l
i
<
r
i
≤n
).
If
t
i
=1
then subbarray
a
l
i
,
a
l
i
+1
,…,
a
r
i
is sorted. Otherwise (if
t
i
=0
) subbarray
a
l
i
,
a
l
i
+1
,…,
a
r
i
is not sorted.
Output
If there is no array that satisfies these facts in only line print NO (in any letter case).
If there is a solution, print YES (in any letter case). In second line print
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the array
a
, satisfying all the given facts. If there are multiple satisfying arrays you can print any of them.
