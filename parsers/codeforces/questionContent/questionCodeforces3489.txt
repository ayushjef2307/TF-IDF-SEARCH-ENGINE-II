Polycarp knows that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by
3
, then the number itself is divisible by
3
. He assumes that the numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by
4
, are also somewhat interesting. Thus, he considers a positive integer
n
interesting if its sum of digits is divisible by
4
.
Help Polycarp find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number
a
. That is, find the interesting number
n
such that
n≥a
and
n
is minimal.
Input
The only line in the input contains an integer
a
(
1≤a≤1000
).
Output
Print the nearest greater or equal interesting number for the given number
a
. In other words, print the interesting number
n
such that
n≥a
and
n
is minimal.
