You are given an undirected connected graph with
n
vertices and
m
edges. Each edge has an associated counter, initially equal to
0
. In one operation, you can choose an arbitrary spanning tree and add any value
v
to all edges of this spanning tree.
Determine if it's possible to make every counter equal to its target value
x
i
modulo prime
p
, and provide a sequence of operations that achieves it.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
, and
p
 — the number of vertices, the number of edges, and the prime modulus (
1≤n≤500
;
1≤m≤1000
;
2≤p≤
10
9
,
p
is prime).
Next
m
lines contain three integers
u
i
,
v
i
,
x
i
each — the two endpoints of the
i
-th edge and the target value of that edge's counter (
1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n
;
0≤
x
i
<p
;
u
i
≠
v
i
).
The graph is connected. There are no loops, but there may be multiple edges between the same two vertices.
Output
If the target values on counters cannot be achieved, print -1.
Otherwise, print
t
 — the number of operations, followed by
t
lines, describing the sequence of operations. Each line starts with integer
v
(
0≤v<p
) — the counter increment for this operation. Then, in the same line, followed by
n−1
integers
e
1
,
e
2
, ...
e
n−1
(
1≤
e
i
≤m
) — the edges of the spanning tree.
The number of operations
t
should not exceed
2m
. You don't need to minimize
t
. Any correct answer within the
2m
bound is accepted. You are allowed to repeat spanning trees.
