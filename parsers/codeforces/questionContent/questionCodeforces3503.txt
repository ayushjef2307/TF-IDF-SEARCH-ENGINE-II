While playing with geometric figures Alex has accidentally invented a concept of a
n
-th order rhombus in a cell grid.
A
1
-st order rhombus is just a square
1×1
(i.e just a cell).
A
n
-th order rhombus for all
n≥2
one obtains from a
n−1
-th order rhombus adding all cells which have a common side with it to it (look at the picture to understand it better).
Alex asks you to compute the number of cells in a
n
-th order rhombus.
Input
The first and only input line contains integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — order of a rhombus whose numbers of cells should be computed.
Output
Print exactly one integer — the number of cells in a
n
-th order rhombus.
