We call a function good if its domain of definition is some set of integers and if in case it's defined in
x
and
x−1
,
f(x)=f(x−1)+1
or
f(x)=f(x−1)
.
Tanya has found
n
good functions
f
1
,…,
f
n
, which are defined on all integers from
0
to
10
18
and
f
i
(0)=0
and
f
i
(
10
18
)=L
for all
i
from
1
to
n
. It's an notorious coincidence that
n
is a divisor of
L
.
She suggests Alesya a game. Using one question Alesya can ask Tanya a value of any single function in any single point. To win Alesya must choose integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
0≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤
10
18
), such that
f
i
(
r
i
)−
f
i
(
l
i
)≥
L
n
(here
f
i
(x)
means the value of
i
-th function at point
x
) for all
i
such that
1≤i≤n
so that for any pair of two functions their segments
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
don't intersect (but may have one common point).
Unfortunately, Tanya doesn't allow to make more than
2⋅
10
5
questions. Help Alesya to win!
It can be proved that it's always possible to choose
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
which satisfy the conditions described above.
It's guaranteed, that Tanya doesn't change functions during the game, i.e. interactor is not adaptive
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
L
(
1≤n≤1000
,
1≤L≤
10
18
,
n
is a divisor of
L
)  — number of functions and their value in
10
18
.
Output
When you've found needed
l
i
,
r
i
, print
"!"
without quotes on a separate line and then
n
lines,
i
-th from them should contain two integers
l
i
,
r
i
divided by space.
Interaction
To ask
f
i
(x)
, print symbol "?" without quotes and then two integers
i
and
x
(
1≤i≤n
,
0≤x≤
10
18
). Note, you must flush your output to get a response.
After that, you should read an integer which is a value of
i
-th function in point
x
.
You're allowed not more than
2⋅
10
5
questions.
To flush you can use (just after printing an integer and end-of-line):
fflush(stdout) in C++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
stdout.flush() in Python;
flush(output) in Pascal;
See the documentation for other languages.
Hacks:
Only tests where
1≤L≤2000
are allowed for hacks, for a hack set a test using following format:
The first line should contain two integers
n
and
L
(
1≤n≤1000
,
1≤L≤2000
,
n
is a divisor of
L
)  — number of functions and their value in
10
18
.
Each of
n
following lines should contain
L
numbers
l
1
,
l
2
, ... ,
l
L
(
0≤
l
j
<
10
18
for all
1≤j≤L
and
l
j
<
l
j+1
for all
1<j≤L
), in
i
-th of them
l
j
means that
f
i
(
l
j
)<
f
i
(
l
j
+1)
.

Note
In the example Tanya has
5
same functions where
f(0)=0
,
f(1)=1
,
f(2)=2
,
f(3)=3
,
f(4)=4
and all remaining points have value
5
.
Alesya must choose two integers for all functions so that difference of values of a function in its points is not less than
L
n
(what is
1
here) and length of intersection of segments is zero.
One possible way is to choose pairs
[0
,
1]
,
[1
,
2]
,
[2
,
3]
,
[3
,
4]
and
[4
,
5]
for functions
1
,
2
,
3
,
4
and
5
respectively.
