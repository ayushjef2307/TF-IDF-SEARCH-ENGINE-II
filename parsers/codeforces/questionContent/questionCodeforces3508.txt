Recently, on the course of algorithms and data structures, Valeriy learned how to use a deque. He built a deque filled with
n
elements. The
i
-th element is
a
i
(
i
=
1,2,…,n
). He gradually takes the first two leftmost elements from the deque (let's call them
A
and
B
, respectively), and then does the following: if
A>B
, he writes
A
to the beginning and writes
B
to the end of the deque, otherwise, he writes to the beginning
B
, and
A
writes to the end of the deque. We call this sequence of actions an operation.
For example, if deque was
[2,3,4,5,1]
, on the operation he will write
B=3
to the beginning and
A=2
to the end, so he will get
[3,4,5,1,2]
.
The teacher of the course, seeing Valeriy, who was passionate about his work, approached him and gave him
q
queries. Each query consists of the singular number
m
j
(j=1,2,…,q)
. It is required for each query to answer which two elements he will pull out on the
m
j
-th operation.
Note that the queries are independent and for each query the numbers
A
and
B
should be printed in the order in which they will be pulled out of the deque.
Deque is a data structure representing a list of elements where insertion of new elements or deletion of existing elements can be made from both sides.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n≤
10
5
,
0≤q≤3⋅
10
5
) — the number of elements in the deque and the number of queries. The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
n
, where
a
i
(0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
)
 — the deque element in
i
-th position. The next
q
lines contain one number each, meaning
m
j
(
1≤
m
j
≤
10
18
).
Output
For each teacher's query, output two numbers
A
and
B
 — the numbers that Valeriy pulls out of the deque for the
m
j
-th operation.

Note
Consider all 10 steps for the first test in detail:
[1,2,3,4,5]
 — on the first operation,
A
and
B
are
1
and
2
, respectively.
So,
2
we write to the beginning of the deque, and
1
 — to the end.
We get the following status of the deque:
[2,3,4,5,1]
.
[2,3,4,5,1]⇒A=2,B=3
.
[3,4,5,1,2]
[4,5,1,2,3]
[5,1,2,3,4]
[5,2,3,4,1]
[5,3,4,1,2]
[5,4,1,2,3]
[5,1,2,3,4]
[5,2,3,4,1]⇒A=5,B=2
.
