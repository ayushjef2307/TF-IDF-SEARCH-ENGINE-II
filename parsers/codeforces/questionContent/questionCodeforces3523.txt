You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers. Each
a
i
is one of the six following numbers:
4,8,15,16,23,42
.
Your task is to remove the minimum number of elements to make this array good.
An array of length
k
is called good if
k
is divisible by
6
and it is possible to split it into
k
6
subsequences
4,8,15,16,23,42
.
Examples of good arrays:
[4,8,15,16,23,42]
(the whole array is a required sequence);
[4,8,4,15,16,8,23,15,16,42,23,42]
(the first sequence is formed from first, second, fourth, fifth, seventh and tenth elements and the second one is formed from remaining elements);
[]
(the empty array is good).
Examples of bad arrays:
[4,8,15,16,42,23]
(the order of elements should be exactly
4,8,15,16,23,42
);
[4,8,15,16,23,42,4]
(the length of the array is not divisible by
6
);
[4,8,15,16,23,42,4,8,15,16,23,23]
(the first sequence can be formed from first six elements but the remaining array cannot form the required sequence).
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
) — the number of elements in
a
.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(each
a
i
is one of the following numbers:
4,8,15,16,23,42
), where
a
i
is the
i
-th element of
a
.
Output
Print one integer — the minimum number of elements you have to remove to obtain a good array.
