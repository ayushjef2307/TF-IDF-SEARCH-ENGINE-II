You are given an integer
n
.
You can perform any of the following operations with this number an arbitrary (possibly, zero) number of times:
Replace
n
with
n
2
if
n
is divisible by
2
;
Replace
n
with
2n
3
if
n
is divisible by
3
;
Replace
n
with
4n
5
if
n
is divisible by
5
.
For example, you can replace
30
with
15
using the first operation, with
20
using the second operation or with
24
using the third operation.
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to obtain
1
from
n
or say that it is impossible to do it.
You have to answer
q
independent queries.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤1000
) — the number of queries.
The next
q
lines contain the queries. For each query you are given the integer number
n
(
1≤n≤
10
18
).
Output
Print the answer for each query on a new line. If it is impossible to obtain
1
from
n
, print -1. Otherwise, print the minimum number of moves required to do it.
