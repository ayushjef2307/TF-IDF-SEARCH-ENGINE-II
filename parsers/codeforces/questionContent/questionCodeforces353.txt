Scientists are researching an impact of football match results on the mood of football fans. They have a hypothesis that there is a correlation between the number of draws and fans' desire to watch football matches in the future.
In football, two teams play a match. The teams score goals throughout a match. A score "
x
:
y
" means that the team we observe scored
x
goals and conceded
y
goals. If
x=y
, then the match ends in a draw. If
x>y
, then the observed team wins, and if
x<y
, then it loses.
To find out if there is a correlation, the scientists gathered information about the results of teams in lower leagues. The information they found is the number of matches played by the team (
n
), the number of goals scored in these matches (
a
), and the number of goals conceded in these matches (
b
).
You are given this information for a single team. You are asked to calculate the minimum number of draws that could have happened during the team's matches and provide a list of match scores with the minimum number of draws.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
 — the number of matches played by the team (
1≤n≤100
). The second line contains an integer
a
 — the total number of goals scored by the team in all
n
matches (
0≤a≤1000
). The third line contains an integer
b
 — the total number of goals conceded by the team in all
n
matches (
0≤b≤1000
).
Output
In the first line, print a single integer
d
 — the minimum number of draws.
In the following
n
lines, print a list of match scores, each line in the format "
x
:
y
", where
x
is the number of goals scored in the match, and
y
 – the number of goals conceded, so that exactly
d
of these matches have ended in a draw. In case multiple such lists of match scores exist, print any of them.
