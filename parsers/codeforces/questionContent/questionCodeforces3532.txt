You are given an integer
n
and an integer
k
.
In one step you can do one of the following moves:
decrease
n
by
1
;
divide
n
by
k
if
n
is divisible by
k
.
For example, if
n=27
and
k=3
you can do the following steps:
27→26→25→24→8→7→6→2→1→0
.
You are asked to calculate the minimum number of steps to reach
0
from
n
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of queries.
The only line of each query contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤
10
18
,
2≤k≤
10
18
).
Output
For each query print the minimum number of steps to reach
0
from
n
in single line.

Note
Steps for the first test case are:
59→58→57→19→18→6→2→1→0
.
In the second test case you have to divide
n
by
k
18
times and then decrease
n
by
1
.
