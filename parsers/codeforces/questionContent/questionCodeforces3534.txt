Let's define a function
f(p)
on a permutation
p
as follows. Let
g
i
be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of elements
p
1
,
p
2
, ...,
p
i
(in other words, it is the GCD of the prefix of length
i
). Then
f(p)
is the number of distinct elements among
g
1
,
g
2
, ...,
g
n
.
Let
f
max
(n)
be the maximum value of
f(p)
among all permutations
p
of integers
1
,
2
, ...,
n
.
Given an integers
n
, count the number of permutations
p
of integers
1
,
2
, ...,
n
, such that
f(p)
is equal to
f
max
(n)
. Since the answer may be large, print the remainder of its division by
1000000007=
10
9
+7
.
Input
The only line contains the integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
6
) — the length of the permutations.
Output
The only line should contain your answer modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
Consider the second example: these are the permutations of length
3
:
[1,2,3]
,
f(p)=1
.
[1,3,2]
,
f(p)=1
.
[2,1,3]
,
f(p)=2
.
[2,3,1]
,
f(p)=2
.
[3,1,2]
,
f(p)=2
.
[3,2,1]
,
f(p)=2
.
The maximum value
f
max
(3)=2
, and there are
4
permutations
p
such that
f(p)=2
.
