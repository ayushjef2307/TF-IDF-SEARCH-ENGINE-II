Nauuo is a girl who loves playing chess.
One day she invented a game by herself which needs
n
chess pieces to play on a
m×m
chessboard. The rows and columns are numbered from
1
to
m
. We denote a cell on the intersection of the
r
-th row and
c
-th column as
(r,c)
.
The game's goal is to place
n
chess pieces numbered from
1
to
n
on the chessboard, the
i
-th piece lies on
(
r
i
,
c
i
)
, while the following rule is satisfied: for all pairs of pieces
i
and
j
,
|
r
i
−
r
j
|+|
c
i
−
c
j
|≥|i−j|
. Here
|x|
means the absolute value of
x
.
However, Nauuo discovered that sometimes she couldn't find a solution because the chessboard was too small.
She wants to find the smallest chessboard on which she can put
n
pieces according to the rules.
She also wonders how to place the pieces on such a chessboard. Can you help her?
Input
The only line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤1000
) — the number of chess pieces for the game.
Output
The first line contains a single integer — the minimum value of
m
, where
m
is the length of sides of the suitable chessboard.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains two integers
r
i
and
c
i
(
1≤
r
i
,
c
i
≤m
) — the coordinates of the
i
-th chess piece.
If there are multiple answers, print any.

Note
In the first example, you can't place the two pieces on a
1×1
chessboard without breaking the rule. But you can place two pieces on a
2×2
chessboard like this:
In the second example, you can't place four pieces on a
2×2
chessboard without breaking the rule. For example, if you place the pieces like this:
then

However, on a
3×3
chessboard, you can place four pieces like this:
