Nauuo is a girl who loves playing cards.
One day she was playing cards but found that the cards were mixed with some empty ones.
There are
n
cards numbered from
1
to
n
, and they were mixed with another
n
empty cards. She piled up the
2n
cards and drew
n
of them. The
n
cards in Nauuo's hands are given. The remaining
n
cards in the pile are also given in the order from top to bottom.
In one operation she can choose a card in her hands and play it — put it at the bottom of the pile, then draw the top card from the pile.
Nauuo wants to make the
n
numbered cards piled up in increasing order (the
i
-th card in the pile from top to bottom is the card
i
) as quickly as possible. Can you tell her the minimum number of operations?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of numbered cards.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤n
) — the initial cards in Nauuo's hands.
0
represents an empty card.
The third line contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
0≤
b
i
≤n
) — the initial cards in the pile, given in order from top to bottom.
0
represents an empty card.
It is guaranteed that each number from
1
to
n
appears exactly once, either in
a
1..n
or
b
1..n
.
Output
The output contains a single integer — the minimum number of operations to make the
n
numbered cards piled up in increasing order.

Note
Example 1
We can play the card
2
and draw the card
3
in the first operation. After that, we have
[0,3,0]
in hands and the cards in the pile are
[0,1,2]
from top to bottom.
Then, we play the card
3
in the second operation. The cards in the pile are
[1,2,3]
, in which the cards are piled up in increasing order.
Example 2
Play an empty card and draw the card
1
, then play
1
,
2
,
3
in order.
