You are given the sequence
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. You can choose any subset of elements and then reorder them to create a "saw".
The sequence
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
m
is called a "saw" if the elements satisfy one of the following series of inequalities:
b
1
>
b
2
<
b
3
>
b
4
<…
or
b
1
<
b
2
>
b
3
<
b
4
>…
.
Find the longest saw which can be obtained from a given array.
Note that both the given sequence
a
and the required saw
b
can contain duplicated (non-unique) values.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases in the input. Then the descriptions of the
t
test cases follow. Each test case begins with a line containing integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
). Then a line containing
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) follows.
It's guaranteed that
∑n
doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print two lines: print the length of the longest saw in the first line, and the saw itself in the second line. If there are several solutions, print any of them.
