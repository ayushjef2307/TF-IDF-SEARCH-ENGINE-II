Every day Kotlin heroes analyze the statistics of their website. For
n
days, they wrote out
n
numbers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
, where
a
i
is the number of visits on the
i
-th day.
They believe that a day is bad if there are at least
2
days before it with a strictly greater number of visits. For example, if
n=8
and
a=[3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6]
, then the day
4
is bad (because
a
4
=1
, but there are
a
1
=3
and
a
3
=4
). Also, the day with the number
7
is bad too.
Write a program that finds the number of bad days.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
), where
n
is the number of days. The second line contains
n
positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
), where
a
i
is the number of website visits on the
i
-th day.
Output
Print the number of bad days, i.e. such days that there are at least two days before it with a strictly greater number of visits.
