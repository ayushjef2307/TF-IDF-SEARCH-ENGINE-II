Toad Rash has a binary string
s
. A binary string consists only of zeros and ones.
Let
n
be the length of
s
.
Rash needs to find the number of such pairs of integers
l
,
r
that
1≤l≤r≤n
and there is at least one pair of integers
x
,
k
such that
1≤x,k≤n
,
l≤x<x+2k≤r
, and
s
x
=
s
x+k
=
s
x+2k
.
Find this number of pairs for Rash.
Input
The first line contains the string
s
(
1≤|s|≤300000
), consisting of zeros and ones.
Output
Output one integer: the number of such pairs of integers
l
,
r
that
1≤l≤r≤n
and there is at least one pair of integers
x
,
k
such that
1≤x,k≤n
,
l≤x<x+2k≤r
, and
s
x
=
s
x+k
=
s
x+2k
.

Note
In the first example, there are three
l
,
r
pairs we need to count:
1
,
6
;
2
,
6
; and
1
,
5
.
In the second example, there are no values
x
,
k
for the initial string, so the answer is
0
.
