You are given an array consisting of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and an integer
x
. It is guaranteed that for every
i
,
1≤
a
i
≤x
.
Let's denote a function
f(l,r)
which erases all values such that
l≤
a
i
≤r
from the array
a
and returns the resulting array. For example, if
a=[4,1,1,4,5,2,4,3]
, then
f(2,4)=[1,1,5]
.
Your task is to calculate the number of pairs
(l,r)
such that
1≤l≤r≤x
and
f(l,r)
is sorted in non-descending order. Note that the empty array is also considered sorted.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
x
(
1≤n,x≤
10
6
) — the length of array
a
and the upper limit for its elements, respectively.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤x
).
Output
Print the number of pairs
1≤l≤r≤x
such that
f(l,r)
is sorted in non-descending order.
