Alice is a magician and she creates a new trick. She has
n
cards with different numbers from
1
to
n
written on them. First, she asks an audience member to shuffle the deck and put cards in a row. Let's say the
i
-th card from the left has the number
a
i
on it.
Then Alice picks two permutations
p
and
q
. There is a restriction on
p
and
q
 — permutations can't have fixed points. Which means
∀i:
p
i
≠i and 
q
i
≠i
.
After permutations are chosen, Alice shuffles the cards according to them. Now the
i
-th card from the left is the card
a[p[q[i]]
. The trick is considered successful if
i
-th card from the left has the number
i
on it after the shuffles.
Help Alice pick the permutations
p
and
q
or say it is not possible for the specific starting permutation
a
.
Input
The first line of the input contains the number of tests
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
).
Each test is described in two lines. The first line contains one integer
n
 — the number of cards (
1≤n≤
10
5
). The second line contains
n
integers
a
i
 — the initial permutation of the cards (
1≤
a
i
≤n
;
∀i≠j:
a
i
≠
a
j
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all tests does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
Print the answer for each test case in the same order the cases appear in the input.
For each test case, print "Impossible" in a single line, if no solution exists.
Otherwise, print "Possible" in the first line, and in the following two lines print permutations
p
and
q
.
