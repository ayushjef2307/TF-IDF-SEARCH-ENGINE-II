The legend of the foundation of Vectorland talks of two integers
x
and
y
. Centuries ago, the array king placed two markers at points
|x|
and
|y|
on the number line and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Arrayland. Many years later, the vector king placed markers at points
|x−y|
and
|x+y|
and conquered all the land in between (including the endpoints), which he declared to be Vectorland. He did so in such a way that the land of Arrayland was completely inside (including the endpoints) the land of Vectorland.
Here
|z|
denotes the absolute value of
z
.
Now, Jose is stuck on a question of his history exam: "What are the values of
x
and
y
?" Jose doesn't know the answer, but he believes he has narrowed the possible answers down to
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. Now, he wants to know the number of unordered pairs formed by two different elements from these
n
integers such that the legend could be true if
x
and
y
were equal to these two values. Note that it is possible that Jose is wrong, and that no pairs could possibly make the legend true.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
)  — the number of choices.
The second line contains
n
pairwise distinct integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the choices Jose is considering.
Output
Print a single integer number — the number of unordered pairs
{x,y}
formed by different numbers from Jose's choices that could make the legend true.

Note
Consider the first sample. For the pair
{2,5}
, the situation looks as follows, with the Arrayland markers at
|2|=2
and
|5|=5
, while the Vectorland markers are located at
|2−5|=3
and
|2+5|=7
:
The legend is not true in this case, because the interval
[2,3]
is not conquered by Vectorland. For the pair
{5,−3}
the situation looks as follows, with Arrayland consisting of the interval
[3,5]
and Vectorland consisting of the interval
[2,8]
:
As Vectorland completely contains Arrayland, the legend is true. It can also be shown that the legend is true for the pair
{2,−3}
, for a total of two pairs.
In the second sample, the only pair is
{3,6}
, and the situation looks as follows:
Note that even though Arrayland and Vectorland share
3
as endpoint, we still consider Arrayland to be completely inside of Vectorland.
