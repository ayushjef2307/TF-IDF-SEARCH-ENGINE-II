Polycarp wants to train before another programming competition. During the first day of his training he should solve exactly
1
problem, during the second day — exactly
2
problems, during the third day — exactly
3
problems, and so on. During the
k
-th day he should solve
k
problems.
Polycarp has a list of
n
contests, the
i
-th contest consists of
a
i
problems. During each day Polycarp has to choose exactly one of the contests he didn't solve yet and solve it. He solves exactly
k
problems from this contest. Other problems are discarded from it. If there are no contests consisting of at least
k
problems that Polycarp didn't solve yet during the
k
-th day, then Polycarp stops his training.
How many days Polycarp can train if he chooses the contests optimally?
Input
