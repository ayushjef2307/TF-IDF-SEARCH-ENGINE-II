You are planning to build housing on a street. There are
n
spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from
1
to
n
from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between
0
and
h
.
In each spot, if a house has height
a
, you will gain
a
2
dollars from it.
The city has
m
zoning restrictions. The
i
-th restriction says that the tallest house from spots
l
i
to
r
i
(inclusive) must be at most
x
i
.
You would like to build houses to maximize your profit. Determine the maximum profit possible.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
h
, and
m
(
1≤n,h,m≤50
) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions.
Each of the next
m
lines contains three integers
l
i
,
r
i
, and
x
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
,
0≤
x
i
≤h
) — left and right limits (inclusive) of the
i
-th restriction and the maximum possible height in that range.
Output
Print a single integer, the maximum profit you can make.

Note
In the first example, there are
3
houses, the maximum height of a house is
3
, and there are
3
restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house between
1
and
1
must be at most
1
. The second restriction says the tallest house between
2
and
2
must be at most
3
. The third restriction says the tallest house between
3
and
3
must be at most
2
.
In this case, it is optimal to build houses with heights
[1,3,2]
. This fits within all the restrictions. The total profit in this case is
1
2
+
3
2
+

=14
.
In the second example, there are
4
houses, the maximum height of a house is
10
, and there are
2
restrictions. The first restriction says the tallest house from
2
to
3
must be at most
8
. The second restriction says the tallest house from
3
to
4
must be at most
7
.
In this case, it's optimal to build houses with heights
[10,8,7,7]
. We get a profit of
10

+

. Note that there are two restrictions on house
3
and both of them must be satisfied. Also, note that even though there isn't any explicit restrictions on house
1
, we must still limit its height to be at most
10
(
h=10
).
