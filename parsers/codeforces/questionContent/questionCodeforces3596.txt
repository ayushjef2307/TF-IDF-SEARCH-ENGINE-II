Vasya has a pile, that consists of some number of stones.
n
times he either took one stone from the pile or added one stone to the pile. The pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.
You are given
n
operations which Vasya has made. Find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations.
Input
The first line contains one positive integer
n
 — the number of operations, that have been made by Vasya (
1≤n≤100
).
The next line contains the string
s
, consisting of
n
symbols, equal to "-" (without quotes) or "+" (without quotes). If Vasya took the stone on
i
-th operation,
s
i
is equal to "-" (without quotes), if added,
s
i
is equal to "+" (without quotes).
Output
Print one integer — the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these
n
operations.

Note
In the first test, if Vasya had
3
stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to
0
. It is impossible to have less number of piles, so the answer is
0
. Please notice, that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less, than
3
, because in this case, Vasya won't be able to take a stone on some operation (the pile will be empty).
In the second test, if Vasya had
0
stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to
4
. It is impossible to have less number of piles because after making
4
operations the number of stones in the pile increases on
4
stones. So, the answer is
4
.
In the third test, if Vasya had
1
stone in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to
1
. It can be proved, that it is impossible to have less number of stones after making the operations.
In the fourth test, if Vasya had
0
stones in the pile at the beginning, after making operations the number of stones will be equal to
3
.
