You are given two arrays
a
and
b
, both of length
n
. All elements of both arrays are from
0
to
n−1
.
You can reorder elements of the array
b
(if you want, you may leave the order of elements as it is). After that, let array
c
be the array of length
n
, the
i
-th element of this array is
c
i
=(
a
i
+
b
i
)%n
, where
x%y
is
x
modulo
y
.
Your task is to reorder elements of the array
b
to obtain the lexicographically minimum possible array
c
.
Array
x
of length
n
is lexicographically less than array
y
of length
n
, if there exists such
i
(
1≤i≤n
), that
x
i
<
y
i
, and for any
j
(
1≤j<i
)
x
j
=
y
j
.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of elements in
a
,
b
and
c
.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
<n
), where
a
i
is the
i
-th element of
a
.
The third line of the input contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
0≤
b
i
<n
), where
b
i
is the
i
-th element of
b
.
Output
Print the lexicographically minimum possible array
c
. Recall that your task is to reorder elements of the array
b
and obtain the lexicographically minimum possible array
c
, where the
i
-th element of
c
is
c
i
=(
a
i
+
b
i
)%n
.
