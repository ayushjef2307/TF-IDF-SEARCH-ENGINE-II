You are given a permutation
p
of
n
integers
1
,
2
, ...,
n
(a permutation is an array where each element from
1
to
n
occurs exactly once).
Let's call some subsegment
p[l,r]
of this permutation special if
p
l
+
p
r
=
max
i=l
r
p
i
. Please calculate the number of special subsegments.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
, ...,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
). All these integers are pairwise distinct.
Output
Print the number of special subsegments of the given permutation.

Note
Special subsegments in the first example are
[1,5]
and
[1,3]
.
The only special subsegment in the second example is
[1,3]
.
