You are given a tree (an undirected connected acyclic graph) consisting of
n
vertices and
n−1
edges. A number is written on each edge, each number is either
0
(let's call such edges
0
-edges) or
1
(those are
1
-edges).
Let's call an ordered pair of vertices
(x,y)
(
x≠y
) valid if, while traversing the simple path from
x
to
y
, we never go through a
0
-edge after going through a
1
-edge. Your task is to calculate the number of valid pairs in the tree.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤200000
) — the number of vertices in the tree.
Then
n−1
lines follow, each denoting an edge of the tree. Each edge is represented by three integers
x
i
,
y
i
and
c
i
(
1≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤n
,
0≤
c
i
≤1
,
x
i
≠
y
i
) — the vertices connected by this edge and the number written on it, respectively.
It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.
Output
Print one integer — the number of valid pairs of vertices.
