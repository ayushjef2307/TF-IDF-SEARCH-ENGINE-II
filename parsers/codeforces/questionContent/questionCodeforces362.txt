An array
a
consisting of
k
integers is strictly increasing if
a
1
<
a
2
<⋯<
a
k
. For example, the arrays
[1,3,5]
,
[1,2,3,4]
,
[3,5,6]
are strictly increasing; the arrays
[2,2]
,
[3,7,5]
,
[7,4,3]
,
[1,2,2,3]
are not.
For a strictly increasing array
a
of
k
elements, let's denote the characteristic as the number of different elements in the array
[
a
2
−
a
1
,
a
3
−
a
2
,…,
a
k
−
a
k−1
]
. For example, the characteristic of the array
[1,3,4,7,8]
is
3
since the array
[2,1,3,1]
contains
3
different elements:
2
,
1
and
3
.
You are given two integers
k
and
n
(
k≤n
). Construct an increasing array of
k
integers from
1
to
n
with maximum possible characteristic.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤819
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing two integers
k
and
n
(
2≤k≤n≤40
).
Output
For each test case, print
k
integers — the elements of the strictly increasing array
a
with the maximum possible characteristic. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
