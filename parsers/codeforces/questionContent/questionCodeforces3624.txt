You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
.
Your problem is to find such pair of indices
i,j
(
1≤i<j≤n
) that
lcm(
a
i
,
a
j
)
is minimum possible.
lcm(x,y)
is the least common multiple of
x
and
y
(minimum positive number such that both
x
and
y
are divisors of this number).
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
6
) — the number of elements in
a
.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
7
), where
a
i
is the
i
-th element of
a
.
Output
Print two integers
i
and
j
(
1≤i<j≤n
) such that the value of
lcm(
a
i
,
a
j
)
is minimum among all valid pairs
i,j
. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.
