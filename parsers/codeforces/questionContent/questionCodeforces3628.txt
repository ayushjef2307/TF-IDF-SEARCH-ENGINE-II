Note
In the first example the best day for start of the trip is Sunday. In this case, during Sunday and Monday the cat will eat fish food, during Tuesday — rabbit stew and during Wednesday — chicken stake. So, after four days of the trip all food will be eaten.
In the second example Polycarp can start his trip in any day of the week. In any case there are food supplies only for one week in Polycarps backpack.
In the third example Polycarp can start his trip in any day, excluding Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. In this case, the cat will eat three different dishes in three days. Nevertheless that after three days of a trip there will be
99
portions of rabbit stew in a backpack, can cannot eat anything in fourth day of a trip.
