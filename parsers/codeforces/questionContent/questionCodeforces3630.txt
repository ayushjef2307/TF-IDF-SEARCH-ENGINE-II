Polycarp has guessed three positive integers
a
,
b
and
c
. He keeps these numbers in secret, but he writes down four numbers on a board in arbitrary order — their pairwise sums (three numbers) and sum of all three numbers (one number). So, there are four numbers on a board in random order:
a+b
,
a+c
,
b+c
and
a+b+c
.
You have to guess three numbers
a
,
b
and
c
using given numbers. Print three guessed integers in any order.
Pay attention that some given numbers
a
,
b
and
c
can be equal (it is also possible that
a=b=c
).

Output
Print such positive integers
a
,
b
and
c
that four numbers written on a board are values
a+b
,
a+c
,
b+c
and
a+b+c
written in some order. Print
a
,
b
and
c
in any order. If there are several answers, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.
