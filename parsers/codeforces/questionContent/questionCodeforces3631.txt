Getting closer and closer to a mathematician, Serval becomes a university student on math major in Japari University. On the Calculus class, his teacher taught him how to calculate the expected length of a random subsegment of a given segment. Then he left a bonus problem as homework, with the award of a garage kit from IOI. The bonus is to extend this problem to the general case as follows.
You are given a segment with length
l
. We randomly choose
n
segments by choosing two points (maybe with non-integer coordinates) from the given segment equiprobably and the interval between the two points forms a segment. You are given the number of random segments
n
, and another integer
k
. The
2n
endpoints of the chosen segments split the segment into
(2n+1)
intervals. Your task is to calculate the expected total length of those intervals that are covered by at least
k
segments of the
n
random segments.
You should find the answer modulo
998244353
.
Input
First line contains three space-separated positive integers
n
,
k
and
l
(
1≤k≤n≤2000
,
1≤l≤
10
9
).
Output
Output one integer — the expected total length of all the intervals covered by at least
k
segments of the
n
random segments modulo
998244353
.
Formally, let
M=998244353
. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction
p
q
, where
p
and
q
are integers and
q≢0(modM)
. Output the integer equal to
p⋅
q
−1
modM
. In other words, output such an integer
x
that
0≤x<M
and
x⋅q≡p(modM)
.
