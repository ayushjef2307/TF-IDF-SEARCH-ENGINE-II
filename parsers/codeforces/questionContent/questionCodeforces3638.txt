This problem is same as the next one, but has smaller constraints.
Aki is playing a new video game. In the video game, he will control Neko, the giant cat, to fly between planets in the Catniverse.
There are
n
planets in the Catniverse, numbered from
1
to
n
. At the beginning of the game, Aki chooses the planet where Neko is initially located. Then Aki performs
k−1
moves, where in each move Neko is moved from the current planet
x
to some other planet
y
such that:
Planet
y
is not visited yet.
1≤y≤x+m
(where
m
is a fixed constant given in the input)
This way, Neko will visit exactly
k
different planets. Two ways of visiting planets are called different if there is some index
i
such that the
i
-th planet visited in the first way is different from the
i
-th planet visited in the second way.
What is the total number of ways to visit
k
planets this way? Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The only line contains three integers
n
,
k
and
m
(
1≤n≤
10
5
,
1≤k≤min(n,12)
,
1≤m≤4
) — the number of planets in the Catniverse, the number of planets Neko needs to visit and the said constant
m
.
Output
Print exactly one integer — the number of different ways Neko can visit exactly
k
planets. Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
In the first example, there are
4
ways Neko can visit all the planets:
1→2→3
2→3→1
3→1→2
3→2→1
In the second example, there are
9
ways Neko can visit exactly
2
planets:
1→2
2→1
2→3
3→1
3→2
3→4
4→1
4→2
4→3
In the third example, with
m=4
, Neko can visit all the planets in any order, so there are
5!=120
ways Neko can visit all the planets.
In the fourth example, Neko only visit exactly
1
planet (which is also the planet he initially located), and there are
100
ways to choose the starting planet for Neko.
