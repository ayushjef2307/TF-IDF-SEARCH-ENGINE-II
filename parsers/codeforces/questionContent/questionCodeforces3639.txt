A permutation of length
k
is a sequence of
k
integers from
1
to
k
containing each integer exactly once. For example, the sequence
[3,1,2]
is a permutation of length
3
.
When Neko was five, he thought of an array
a
of
n
positive integers and a permutation
p
of length
n−1
. Then, he performed the following:
Constructed an array
b
of length
n−1
, where
b
i
=min(
a
i
,
a
i+1
)
.
Constructed an array
c
of length
n−1
, where
c
i
=max(
a
i
,
a
i+1
)
.
Constructed an array
b
′
of length
n−1
, where
b
′
i
=
b
p
i
.
Constructed an array
c
′
of length
n−1
, where
c
′
i
=
c
p
i
.
For example, if the array
a
was
[3,4,6,5,7]
and permutation
p
was
[2,4,1,3]
, then Neko would have constructed the following arrays:
b=[3,4,5,5]
c=[4,6,6,7]
b
′
=[4,5,3,5]
c
′
=[6,7,4,6]
Then, he wrote two arrays
b
′
and
c
′
on a piece of paper and forgot about it. 14 years later, when he was cleaning up his room, he discovered this old piece of paper with two arrays
b
′
and
c
′
written on it. However he can't remember the array
a
and permutation
p
he used.
In case Neko made a mistake and there is no array
a
and permutation
p
resulting in such
b
′
and
c
′
, print -1. Otherwise, help him recover any possible array
a
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of elements in array
a
.
The second line contains
n−1
integers
b
′
1
,
b
′
2
,…,
b
′
n−1
(
1≤
b
′
i
≤
10
9
).
The third line contains
n−1
integers
c
′
1
,
c
′
2
,…,
c
′
n−1
(
1≤
c
′
i
≤
10
9
).
Output
If Neko made a mistake and there is no array
a
and a permutation
p
leading to the
b
′
and
c
′
, print -1. Otherwise, print
n
positive integers
a
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
), denoting the elements of the array
a
.
If there are multiple possible solutions, print any of them.

Note
The first example is explained is the problem statement.
In the third example, for
a=[3,4,5,2,1,4,3,2]
, a possible permutation
p
is
[7,1,5,4,3,2,6]
. In that case, Neko would have constructed the following arrays:
b=[3,4,2,1,1,3,2]
c=[4,5,5,2,4,4,3]
b
′
=[2,3,1,1,2,4,3]
c
′
=[3,4,4,2,5,5,4]
