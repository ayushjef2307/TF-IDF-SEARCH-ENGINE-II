A girl named Sonya is studying in the scientific lyceum of the Kingdom of Kremland. The teacher of computer science (Sonya's favorite subject!) invented a task for her.
Given an array
a
of length
n
, consisting only of the numbers
0
and
1
, and the number
k
. Exactly
k
times the following happens:
Two numbers
i
and
j
are chosen equiprobable such that (
1≤i<j≤n
).
The numbers in the
i
and
j
positions are swapped.
Sonya's task is to find the probability that after all the operations are completed, the
a
array will be sorted in non-decreasing order. She turned to you for help. Help Sonya solve this problem.
It can be shown that the desired probability is either
0
or it can be represented as
P
Q
, where
P
and
Q
are coprime integers and
Q≢0 (mod
10
9
+7)
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤100,1≤k≤
10
9
) — the length of the array
a
and the number of operations.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤1
) — the description of the array
a
.
Output
If the desired probability is
0
, print
0
, otherwise print the value
P⋅
Q
−1
(mod
10
9
+7)
, where
P
and
Q
are defined above.

Note
In the first example, all possible variants of the final array
a
, after applying exactly two operations:
(0,1,0)
,
(0,0,1)
,
(1,0,0)
,
(1,0,0)
,
(0,1,0)
,
(0,0,1)
,
(0,0,1)
,
(1,0,0)
,
(0,1,0)
. Therefore, the answer is
3
9
=
1
3
.
In the second example, the array will not be sorted in non-decreasing order after one operation, therefore the answer is
0
.
