s

bourles.
In the evening, there are
m
opportunities to sell shares. The
i
-th of them allows to sell as many shares as you want, each at the price of
b

bourles. You can't sell more shares than you have.
It's morning now and you possess
r
bourles and no shares.
What is the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening?
Input
The first line of the input contains three integers
n,m,r
(
1≤n≤30
,
1≤m≤30
,
1≤r≤1000
) — the number of ways to buy the shares on the market, the number of ways to sell the shares on the market, and the number of bourles you hold now.

Note
In the first example test, you have
11
bourles in the morning. It's optimal to buy
5
shares of a stock at the price of
2
bourles in the morning, and then to sell all of them at the price of
5
bourles in the evening. It's easy to verify that you'll have
26
bourles after the evening.
In the second example test, it's optimal not to take any action.
