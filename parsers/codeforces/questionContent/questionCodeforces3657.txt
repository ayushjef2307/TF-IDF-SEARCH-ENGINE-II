You are given an array which is initially empty. You need to perform
n
operations of the given format:
"
a
l
r
k
": append
a
to the end of the array. After that count the number of integer pairs
x,y
such that
l≤x≤y≤r
and
mex(
a
x
,
a
x+1
,…,
a
y
)=k
.
The elements of the array are numerated from
1
in the order they are added to the array.
To make this problem more tricky we don't say your real parameters of the queries. Instead your are given
a
′
,
l
′
,
r
′
,
k
′
. To get
a
,
l
,
r
,
k
on the
i
-th operation you need to perform the following:
a:=(
a
′
+lans)mod(n+1)
,
l:=(
l
′
+lans)modi+1
,
r:=(
r
′
+lans)modi+1
,
if
l>r
swap
l
and
r
,
k:=(
k
′
+lans)mod(n+1)
,
where
lans
is the answer to the previous operation, initially
lans
is equal to zero.
i
is the id of the operation, operations are numbered from
1
.
The
mex(S)
, where
S
is a multiset of non-negative integers, is the smallest non-negative integer which does not appear in the set. For example,
mex({2,2,3})=0
and
mex({0,1,4,1,6})=2
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array.
The next
n
lines contain the description of queries.
Each of them
n
lines contains four non-negative integers
a
′
,
l
′
,
r
′
,
k
′
(
0,≤
a
′
,
l
′
,
r
′
,
k
′
≤
10
9
), describing one operation.
Output
For each query print a single integer — the answer to this query.
