You are given
n
pairs of integers
(
a
1
,
b
1
),(
a
2
,
b
2
),…,(
a
n
,
b
n
)
. All of the integers in the pairs are distinct and are in the range from
1
to
2⋅n
inclusive.
Let's call a sequence of integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
2k
good if either
x
1
<
x
2
>
x
3
<…<
x
2k−2
>
x
2k−1
<
x
2k
, or
x
1
>
x
2
<
x
3
>…>
x
2k−2
<
x
2k−1
>
x
2k
.
You need to choose a subset of distinct indices
i
1
,
i
2
,…,
i
t
and their order in a way that if you write down all numbers from the pairs in a single sequence (the sequence would be
a
i
1
,
b
i
1
,
a
i
2
,
b
i
2
,…,
a
i
t
,
b
i
t
), this sequence is good.
What is the largest subset of indices you can choose? You also need to construct the corresponding index sequence
i
1
,
i
2
,…,
i
t
.
Input
The first line contains single integer
n
(
2≤n≤3⋅
10
5
) — the number of pairs.
Each of the next
n
lines contain two numbers —
a
i
and
b
i
(
1≤
a
i
,
b
i
≤2⋅n
) — the elements of the pairs.
It is guaranteed that all integers in the pairs are distinct, that is, every integer from
1
to
2⋅n
is mentioned exactly once.
Output
In the first line print a single integer
t
 — the number of pairs in the answer.
Then print
t
distinct integers
i
1
,
i
2
,…,
i
t
 — the indexes of pairs in the corresponding order.
