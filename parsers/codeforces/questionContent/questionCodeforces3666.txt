inputstandard input

You are given a string
s
consisting of characters "1", "0", and "?". The first character of
s
is guaranteed to be "1". Let
m
be the number of characters in
s
.
Count the number of ways we can choose a pair of integers
a,b
that satisfies the following:
1≤a<b<
2
m
When written without leading zeros, the base-2 representations of
a
and
b
are both palindromes.
The base-2 representation of bitwise XOR of
a
and
b
matches the pattern
s
. We say that
t
matches
s
if the lengths of
t
and
s
are the same and for every
i
, the
i
-th character of
t
is equal to the
i
-th character of
s
, or the
i
-th character of
s
is "?".
Compute this count modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a single string
s
(
1≤|s|≤1000
).
s
consists only of characters "1", "0" and "?". It is guaranteed that the first character of
s
is a "1".
Output
Print a single integer, the count of pairs that satisfy the conditions modulo
998244353
.
