You are given a set of
n
points in a 2D plane. No three points are collinear.
A pentagram is a set of
5
points
A,B,C,D,E
that can be arranged as follows.
Note the length of the line segments don't matter, only that those particular intersections exist.
Count the number of ways to choose
5
points from the given set that form a pentagram.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
5≤n≤300
) — the number of points.
Each of the next
n
lines contains two integers
x
i
,
y
i
(

≤
x
i

y
i
≤

) — the coordinates of the
i
-th point. It is guaranteed that no three points are collinear.
Output
Print a single integer, the number of sets of
5
points that form a pentagram.
