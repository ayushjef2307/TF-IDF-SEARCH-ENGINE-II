You are planning to build housing on a street. There are
n
spots available on the street on which you can build a house. The spots are labeled from
1
to
n
from left to right. In each spot, you can build a house with an integer height between
0
and
h
.
In each spot, if a house has height
a
, you can gain
a
2
dollars from it.
The city has
m
zoning restrictions though. The
i
-th restriction says that if the tallest house from spots
l
i
to
r
i
is strictly more than
x
i
, you must pay a fine of
c
i
.
You would like to build houses to maximize your profit (sum of dollars gained minus fines). Determine the maximum profit possible.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n,h,m
(
1≤n,h,m≤50
) — the number of spots, the maximum height, and the number of restrictions, respectively.
Each of the next
m
lines contains four integers
l
i
,
r
i
,
x
i
,
c

(
1≤

≤n
,

,
1≤

≤5000
).
Output
Print a single integer denoting the maximum profit you can make.

Note
In the first example, it's optimal to build houses with heights
[1,3,2]
. We get a gain of
1
2
+

=14
. We don't violate any restrictions, so there are no fees, so the total profit is
14−0=14
.
In the second example, it's optimal to build houses with heights
[10,8,8,10]
. We get a gain of

, and we violate the second restriction for a fee of

, thus the total profit is
328−39=289
. Note that even though there isn't a restriction on building
1
, we must still limit its height to be at most
10
.
