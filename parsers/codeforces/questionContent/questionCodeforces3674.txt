A frog is initially at position
0
on the number line. The frog has two positive integers
a
and
b
. From a position
k
, it can either jump to position
k+a
or
k−b
.
Let
f(x)
be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval
[0,x]
. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from
0
.
Given an integer
m
, find
∑
m
i=0
f(i)
. That is, find the sum of all
f(i)
for
i
from
0
to
m
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
m,a,b
(
1≤m≤
10
9
,1≤a,b≤
10
5
).
Output
Print a single integer, the desired sum.

Note
In the first example, we must find
f(0)+f(1)+…+f(7)
. We have
f(0)=1,f(1)=1,f(2)=1,f(3)=1,f(4)=1,f(5)=3,f(6)=3,f(7)=8
. The sum of these values is
19
.
In the second example, we have
f(i)=i+1
, so we want to find
∑
10

i=0
i+1
.
In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
