Hossam has
n
trainees. He assigned a number
a
i
for the
i
-th trainee.
A pair of the
i
-th and
j
-th (
i≠j
) trainees is called successful if there is an integer
x
(
x≥2
), such that
x
divides
a
i
, and
x
divides
a
j
.
Hossam wants to know if there is a successful pair of trainees.
Hossam is very tired now, so he asks you for your help!
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
), the number of test cases. A description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer number
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers, the number of each trainee
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
Print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if there is a successful pair of trainees and "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case.
