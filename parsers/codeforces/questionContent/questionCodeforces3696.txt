Traveling around the world you noticed that many shop owners raise prices to inadequate values if the see you are a foreigner.
You define inadequate numbers as follows:
all integers from
1
to
9
are inadequate;
for an integer
x≥10
to be inadequate, it is required that the integer
⌊x/10⌋
is inadequate, but that's not the only condition. Let's sort all the inadequate integers. Let
⌊x/10⌋
have number
k
in this order. Then, the integer
x
is inadequate only if the last digit of
x
is strictly less than the reminder of division of
k
by
11
.
Here
⌊x/10⌋
denotes
x/10
rounded down.
Thus, if
x
is the
m
-th in increasing order inadequate number, and
m
gives the remainder
c
when divided by
11
, then integers
10⋅x+0,10⋅x+1…,10⋅x+(c−1)
are inadequate, while integers
10⋅x+c,10⋅x+(c+1),…,10⋅x+9
are not inadequate.
The first several inadequate integers are
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,20,21,30,31,32…
. After that, since
4
is the fourth inadequate integer,
40,41,42,43
are inadequate, while
44,45,46,…,49
are not inadequate; since
10
is the
10
-th inadequate number, integers
100,101,102,…,109
are all inadequate. And since
20
is the
11
-th inadequate number, none of
200,201,202,…,209
is inadequate.
You wrote down all the prices you have seen in a trip. Unfortunately, all integers got concatenated in one large digit string
s
and you lost the bounds between the neighboring integers. You are now interested in the number of substrings of the resulting string that form an inadequate number. If a substring appears more than once at different positions, all its appearances are counted separately.
Input
The only line contains the string
s
(
1≤|s|≤
10
5
), consisting only of digits. It is guaranteed that the first digit of
s
is not zero.
Output
In the only line print the number of substrings of
s
that form an inadequate number.

Note
In the first example the inadequate numbers in the string are
1,2,4,21,40,402
.
In the second example the inadequate numbers in the string are
1
and
10
, and
1
appears twice (on the first and on the second positions).
