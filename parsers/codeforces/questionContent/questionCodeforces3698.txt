Recently Lynyrd and Skynyrd went to a shop where Lynyrd bought a permutation
p
of length
n
, and Skynyrd bought an array
a
of length
m
, consisting of integers from
1
to
n
.
Lynyrd and Skynyrd became bored, so they asked you
q
queries, each of which has the following form: "does the subsegment of
a
from the
l
-th to the
r
-th positions, inclusive, have a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of
p
?" Please answer the queries.
A permutation of length
n
is a sequence of
n
integers such that each integer from
1
to
n
appears exactly once in it.
A cyclic shift of a permutation
(
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
)
is a permutation
(
p
i
,
p
i+1
,…,
p
n
,
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
i−1
)
for some
i
from
1
to
n
. For example, a permutation
(2,1,3)
has three distinct cyclic shifts:
(2,1,3)
,
(1,3,2)
,
(3,2,1)
.
A subsequence of a subsegment of array
a
from the
l
-th to the
r
-th positions, inclusive, is a sequence
a
i
1
,
a
i
2
,…,
a
i
k
for some
i
1
,
i
2
,…,
i
k
such that
l≤
i
1
<
i
2
<…<
i
k
≤r
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
,
q
(
1≤n,m,q≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the permutation
p
, the length of the array
a
and the number of queries.
The next line contains
n
integers from
1
to
n
, where the
i
-th of them is the
i
-th element of the permutation. Each integer from
1
to
n
appears exactly once.
The next line contains
m
integers from
1
to
n
, the
i
-th of them is the
i
-th element of the array
a
.
The next
q
lines describe queries. The
i
-th of these lines contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤m
), meaning that the
i
-th query is about the subsegment of the array from the
l
i
-th to the
r
i
-th positions, inclusive.
Output
Print a single string of length
q
, consisting of
0
and
1
, the digit on the
i
-th positions should be
1
, if the subsegment of array
a
from the
l
i
-th to the
r
i
-th positions, inclusive, contains a subsequence that is a cyclic shift of
p
, and
0
otherwise.

Note
In the first example the segment from the
1
-st to the
5
-th positions is
1,2,3,1,2
. There is a subsequence
1,3,2
that is a cyclic shift of the permutation. The subsegment from the
2
-nd to the
6
-th positions also contains a subsequence
2,1,3
that is equal to the permutation. The subsegment from the
3
-rd to the
5
-th positions is
3,1,2
, there is only one subsequence of length
3
(
3,1,2
), but it is not a cyclic shift of the permutation.
In the second example the possible cyclic shifts are
1,2
and
2,1
. The subsegment from the
1
-st to the
2
-nd positions is
1,1
, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation. The subsegment from the
2
-nd to the
3
-rd positions is
1,2
, it coincides with the permutation. The subsegment from the
3
to the
4
positions is
2,2
, its subsequences are not cyclic shifts of the permutation.
