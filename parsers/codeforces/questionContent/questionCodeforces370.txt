Hossam woke up bored, so he decided to create an interesting array with his friend Hazem.
Now, they have an array
a
of
n
positive integers, Hossam will choose a number
a
i
and Hazem will choose a number
a
j
.
Count the number of interesting pairs
(
a
i
,
a
j
)
that meet all the following conditions:
1≤i,j≤n
;
i≠j
;
The absolute difference
|
a
i
−
a
j
|
must be equal to the maximum absolute difference over all the pairs in the array. More formally,
|
a
i
−
a
j
|=

1≤p,q≤n

−

.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
), which denotes the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
5
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print an integer — the number of interesting pairs
(
a
i
,
a
j
)
.

Note
In the first example, the two ways are:
Hossam chooses the fourth number
8
and Hazem chooses the fifth number
1
.
Hossam chooses the fifth number
1
and Hazem chooses the fourth number
8
.
In the second example, the four ways are:
Hossam chooses the second number
2
and Hazem chooses the sixth number
10
.
Hossam chooses the sixth number
10
and Hazem chooses the second number
2
.
Hossam chooses the fifth number
2
and Hazem chooses the sixth number
10
.
Hossam chooses the sixth number
10
and Hazem chooses the fifth number
2
.
