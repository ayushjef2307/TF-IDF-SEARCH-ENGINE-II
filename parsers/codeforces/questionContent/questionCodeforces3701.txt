This problem is given in two editions, which differ exclusively in the constraints on the number
n
.
You are given an array of integers
a[1],a[2],…,a[n].
A block is a sequence of contiguous (consecutive) elements
a[l],a[l+1],…,a[r]
(
1≤l≤r≤n
). Thus, a block is defined by a pair of indices
(l,r)
.
Find a set of blocks
(
l
1
,
r
1
),(
l
2
,
r
2
),…,(
l
k
,
r
k
)
such that:
They do not intersect (i.e. they are disjoint). Formally, for each pair of blocks
(
l
i
,
r
i
)
and
(
l
j
,
r
j
) where
i≠j
either
r
i
<
l
j
or
r
j
<
l
i
.
For each block the sum of its elements is the same. Formally,
a[
l
1
]+a[
l
1
+1]+⋯+a[
r
1
]=a[
l
2
]+a[
l
2
+1]+⋯+a[
r

]=
[

[

⋯=
=
a[
l
k
]+a[
l
k
+1]+⋯+a[
r
k
].

The number of the blocks in the set is maximum. Formally, there does not exist a set of blocks
(
l
′
1
,
r

),(
l

satisfying the above two requirements with
k

.
The picture corresponds to the first example. Blue boxes illustrate blocks.
Write a program to find such a set of blocks.
Input
The first line contains integer
n
(
1≤n≤1500
) — the length of the given array. The second line contains the sequence of elements
a[1],a[2],…,a[n]
(
−

5
≤
a
i
≤
10
5
).
Output
In the first line print the integer
k
(
1≤k≤n
). The following
k
lines should contain blocks, one per line. In each line print a pair of indices
l
i
,
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
) — the bounds of the
i
-th block. You can print blocks in any order. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
