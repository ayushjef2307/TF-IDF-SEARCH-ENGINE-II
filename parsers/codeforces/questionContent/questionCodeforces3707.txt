Polycarp plays "Game 23". Initially he has a number
n
and his goal is to transform it to
m
. In one move, he can multiply
n
by
2
or multiply
n
by
3
. He can perform any number of moves.
Print the number of moves needed to transform
n
to
m
. Print -1 if it is impossible to do so.
It is easy to prove that any way to transform
n
to
m
contains the same number of moves (i.e. number of moves doesn't depend on the way of transformation).
Input
The only line of the input contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤m≤5⋅
10
8
).
Output
Print the number of moves to transform
n
to
m
, or -1 if there is no solution.

Note
In the first example, the possible sequence of moves is:
120→240→720→1440→4320→12960→25920→51840.
The are
7
steps in total.
In the second example, no moves are needed. Thus, the answer is
0
.
In the third example, it is impossible to transform
48
to
72
.
