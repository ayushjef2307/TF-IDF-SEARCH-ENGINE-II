There are
m
people living in a city. There are
n
dishes sold in the city. Each dish
i
has a price
p
i
, a standard
s
i
and a beauty
b
i
. Each person
j
has an income of
in
c
j
and a preferred beauty
pre
f
j
.
A person would never buy a dish whose standard is less than the person's income. Also, a person can't afford a dish with a price greater than the income of the person. In other words, a person
j
can buy a dish
i
only if
p

. In other words, if the price of the dish is less than the person's income by

k
between the beauty of the dish and his/her preferred beauty.
Print the number of dishes that can be bought by each person in the city.

The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
