inputstandard input

You went to the store, selling
n
types of chocolates. There are
a
i
chocolates of type
i
in stock.
You have unlimited amount of cash (so you are not restricted by any prices) and want to buy as many chocolates as possible. However if you buy
x
i
chocolates of type
i
(clearly,
0≤
x
i
≤
a
i
), then for all
1≤j<i
at least one of the following must hold:
x
j
=0
(you bought zero chocolates of type
j
)
x
j
<
x
i
(you bought less chocolates of type
j
than of type
i
)
For example, the array
x=[0,0,1,2,10]
satisfies the requirement above (assuming that all
a
i
≥
x
i
), while arrays
x=[0,1,0]
,
x=[5,5]
and
x=[3,2]
don't.
Calculate the maximum number of chocolates you can buy.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
), denoting the number of types of chocolate.
The next line contains
n
integers
a
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
), denoting the number of chocolates of each type.
