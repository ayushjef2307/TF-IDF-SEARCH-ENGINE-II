You are given a string
s=
s
1
s
2
…
s
n
of length
n
, which only contains digits
1
,
2
, ...,
9
.
A substring
s[l…r]
of
s
is a string
s
l
s
l+1
s
l+2
…
s
r
. A substring
s[l…r]
of
s
is called even if the number represented by it is even.
Find the number of even substrings of
s
. Note, that even if some substrings are equal as strings, but have different
l
and
r
, they are counted as different substrings.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤65000
) — the length of the string
s
.
The second line contains a string
s
of length
n
. The string
s
consists only of digits
1
,
2
, ...,
9
.
Output
Print the number of even substrings of
s
.

Note
In the first example, the
[l,r]
pairs corresponding to even substrings are:
s[1…2]
s[2…2]
s[1…4]
s[2…4]
s[3…4]
s[4…4]
In the second example, all
10
substrings of
s
are even substrings. Note, that while substrings
s[1…1]
and
s[2…2]
both define the substring "2", they are still counted as different substrings.
