You are a coach at your local university. There are
n
students under your supervision, the programming skill of the
i
-th student is
a
i
.
You have to create a team for a new programming competition. As you know, the more students some team has the more probable its victory is! So you have to create a team with the maximum number of students. But you also know that a team should be balanced. It means that the programming skill of each pair of students in a created team should differ by no more than
5
.
Your task is to report the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of students.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
), where
a
i
is a programming skill of the
i
-th student.
Output
Print one integer — the maximum possible number of students in a balanced team.

Note
In the first example you can create a team with skills
[12,17,15]
.
In the second example you can take all students in a team because their programming skills are equal.
In the third example you can create a team consisting of a single student (and you cannot create a team consisting of at least two students).
