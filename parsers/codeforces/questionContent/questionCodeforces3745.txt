inputstandard input
outputstandard output
You have a long fence which consists of
n
sections. Unfortunately, it is not painted, so you decided to hire
q
painters to paint it.
i
-th painter will paint all sections
x
such that
l
i
≤x≤
r
i
.
Unfortunately, you are on a tight budget, so you may hire only
q−2
painters. Obviously, only painters you hire will do their work.
You want to maximize the number of painted sections if you choose
q−2
painters optimally. A section is considered painted if at least one painter paints it.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
3≤n,q≤5000
) — the number of sections and the number of painters availible for hire, respectively.
Then
q
lines follow, each describing one of the painters:
i
-th line contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
).
Output
Print one integer — maximum number of painted sections if you hire
q−2
painters.
