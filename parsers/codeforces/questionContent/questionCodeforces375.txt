Koxia and Mahiru are playing a game with three arrays
a
,
b
, and
c
of length
n
. Each element of
a
,
b
and
c
is an integer between
1
and
n
inclusive.
The game consists of
n
rounds. In the
i
-th round, they perform the following moves:
Let
S
be the multiset
{
a
i
,
b
i
,
c
i
}
.
Koxia removes one element from the multiset
S
by her choice.
Mahiru chooses one integer from the two remaining in the multiset
S
.
Let
d
i
be the integer Mahiru chose in the
i
-th round. If
d
is a permutation
†
†
, Koxia wins. Otherwise, Mahiru wins.
Currently, only the arrays
a
and
b
have been chosen. As an avid supporter of Koxia, you want to choose an array
c
such that Koxia will win. Count the number of such
c
, modulo
998244353
.
Note that Koxia and Mahiru both play optimally.
†
†
A permutation of length
n
is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array), and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the size of the arrays.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
).
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤n
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
Output a single integer — the number of
c
makes Koxia win, modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case, there are
6
possible arrays
c
that make Koxia win —
[1,2,3]
,
[1,3,2]
,
[2,2,3]
,
[2,3,2]
,
[3,2,3]
,
[3,3,2]
.
In the second test case, it can be proved that no array
c
makes Koxia win.
