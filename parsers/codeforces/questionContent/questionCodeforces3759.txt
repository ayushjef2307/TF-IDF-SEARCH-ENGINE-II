Find the number of ways to divide an array
a
of
n
integers into any number of disjoint non-empty segments so that, in each segment, there exist at most
k
distinct integers that appear exactly once.
Since the answer can be large, find it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains two space-separated integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of elements in the array
a
and the restriction from the statement.
The following line contains
n
space-separated integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
) — elements of the array
a
.
Output
The first and only line contains the number of ways to divide an array
a
modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first sample, the three possible divisions are as follows.
[[1],[1],[2]]
[[1,1],[2]]
[[1,1,2]]
Division
[[1],[1,2]]
is not possible because two distinct integers appear exactly once in the second segment
[1,2]
.
