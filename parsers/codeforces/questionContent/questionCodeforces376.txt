Joi has an array
a
of
n
positive integers. Koxia wants you to determine whether there exists a positive integer
x>0
such that
gcd(
a
i
+x,
a
j
+x)=1
for all
1≤i<j≤n
.
Here
gcd(y,z)
denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers
y
and
z
.
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤100
) — the size of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
18
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
1000
.
Output
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if there exists a positive integer
x
such that
gcd(
a
i
+x,
a
j
+x)=1
for all
1≤i<j≤n
, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

Note
In the first test case, we can set
x=4
. This is valid because:
When
i=1
and
j=2
,
gcd(
a
i
+x,
a
j
+x)=gcd(5+4,7+4)=gcd(9,11)=1
.
When
i=1
and
j=3
,
gcd(
a
i
+x,
a
j
+x)=gcd(5+4,10+4)=gcd(9,14)=1
.
When
i=2
and
j=3
,
gcd(
a
i
+x,
a
j
+x)=gcd(7+4,10+4)=gcd(11,14)=1
.
In the second test case, any choice of
x
makes
gcd(
a
1
+x,
a
2
+x)=gcd(3+x,3+x)=3+x
. Therefore, no such
x
exists.
