Implement a quantum oracle on
N
qubits which checks whether the bits in the input vector
x
⃗ 
→
form a periodic bit string (i.e., implements the function
f(
x
⃗ 
)=1
if
x
⃗ 
→
is periodic, and 0 otherwise).
A bit string of length
N
is considered periodic with period
P
(
1≤P≤N−1
) if for all
i∈[0,N−P−1]
x
i
=
x
i+P
. Note that
P
does not have to divide
N
evenly; for example, bit string "01010" is periodic with period
P=2
.
You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:
an array of
N
(
2≤N≤7
) qubits
x
in an arbitrary state (input register),
a qubit
y
in an arbitrary state (output qubit),
and performs a transformation
|x⟩|y⟩→|x⟩|y⊕f(x)⟩
. The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits. Note that the input register
x
has to remain unchanged after applying the operation.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : Unit {
        body (...) {
            // your code here
        }
        adjoint auto;
    }
}
Note: the operation has to have an adjoint specified for it; adjoint auto means that the adjoint will be generated automatically. For details on adjoint, see Operation Definitions.
You are not allowed to use measurements in your operation.
