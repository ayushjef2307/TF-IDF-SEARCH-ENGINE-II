You are given
N
qubits in the zero state
|0...0⟩
. You are also given four distinct bit vectors which describe four different basis states on
N
qubits
|
ψ
i
⟩
.
Your task is to generate a state which is an equal superposition of the given basis states:
|S⟩=
1
2
(|
ψ
0
⟩+|
ψ
1

You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:
an array of
N
(
2≤N≤16
) qubits,
a two-dimensional array of Boolean values
bits
representing the basis states
|
ψ
i
⟩
.
bits
will have exactly 4 elements, each of
bits[i]
describing the basis state
|
ψ
i
⟩
. Each of
bits[i]
will have
N
elements,
bits[i][j]
giving the state of qubit
j
in the basis state
|
ψ
i
⟩
. Bit values true and false corresponding to
|1⟩
and
|0⟩
states, respectively; for example, for
N=2
an array [false, true] will represent the basis state
|01⟩
. Each pair of
bits[i]
and
bits[j]
will differ in at least one position for
i≠j
.
The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[], bits : Bool[][]) : Unit {
        // your code here
    }
}
