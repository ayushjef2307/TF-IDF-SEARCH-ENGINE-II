You are given two qubits in state
|00⟩
. Your task is to create the following state on them:
1
3
–
√
(|00⟩+|01⟩+|10⟩)
1
You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 2 qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Unit {
        // your code here
    }
}
