You are given two segments
[
l
1
;
r
1
]
and
[
l
2
;
r
2
]
on the
x
-axis. It is guaranteed that
l
1
<
r
1
and
l
2
<
r
2
. Segments may intersect, overlap or even coincide with each other.
The example of two segments on the
x
-axis.
Your problem is to find two integers
a
and
b
such that
l
1
≤a≤
r
1
,
l
2
≤b≤
r
2
and
a≠b
. In other words, you have to choose two distinct integer points in such a way that the first point belongs to the segment
[
l
1
;
r
1
]
and the second one belongs to the segment
[
l
2
;
r
2
]
.
It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any of them.
You have to answer
q
independent queries.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤500
) — the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines contains four integers
l
1
i
,
r
1
i
,
l
2
i
and
r
2
i
(
1≤
l

,
r

,
l
2

l

,
l

i
) — the ends of the segments in the
i
-th query.
Output
Print
2q
integers. For the
i
-th query print two integers
a
i
and
b
i
— such numbers that
l
1
i
≤
a
i
≤
r
1
i
,
l
2
i
≤
b
i
≤
r

i
and
a

≠
b
i
. Queries are numbered in order of the input.
It is guaranteed that the answer exists. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.
