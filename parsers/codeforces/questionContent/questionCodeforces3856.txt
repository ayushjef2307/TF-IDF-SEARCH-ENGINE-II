Lunar New Year is approaching, and Bob received a gift from his friend recently — a recursive sequence! He loves this sequence very much and wants to play with it.
Let
f
1
,
f
2
,…,
f
i
,…
be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Bob knows that for
i>k
,
f
i
can be obtained by the following recursive equation:
f
i
=(
f
b
1
i−1
⋅
f
b
2
i−2
⋅⋯⋅
f
b
k
i−k
)modp,
b
b
b
which in short is
f
i
=(
∏
j=1
k
f
b
j
i−j
)modp,
k
b
where
p=998244353
(a widely-used prime),
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
k
are known integer constants, and
xmody
denotes the remainder of
x
divided by
y
.
Bob lost the values of
f
1
,
f
2
,…,
f
k
, which is extremely troublesome – these are the basis of the sequence! Luckily, Bob remembers the first
k−1
elements of the sequence:
f
1
=
f
2
=…=
f
k−1
=1
and the
n
-th element:
f
n
=m
. Please find any possible value of
f
k
. If no solution exists, just tell Bob that it is impossible to recover his favorite sequence, regardless of Bob's sadness.
Input
The first line contains a positive integer
k
(
1≤k≤100
), denoting the length of the sequence
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
k
.
The second line contains
k
positive integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
k
(
1≤
b
i
<p
).
The third line contains two positive integers
n
and
m
(
k<n≤
10
9
,
1≤m<p
), which implies
f
n
=m
.
Output
Output a possible value of
f
k
, where
f
k
is a positive integer satisfying
1≤
f
k
<p
. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If no such
f
k
makes
f
n
=m
, output
−1
instead.
It is easy to show that if there are some possible values of
f
k
, there must be at least one satisfying
1≤
f
k
<p
.

Note
In the first sample, we have
f
4
=
f

3
⋅
f

⋅
f

. Therefore, applying
f
3
=4
, we have
f
4
=16
. Note that there can be multiple answers.
In the third sample, applying
f
7
=1
makes
f
23333
=1
.
In the fourth sample, no such
f
1
makes
f
88888
=66666
. Therefore, we output
−1
instead.
