Ayoub had an array
a
of integers of size
n
and this array had two interesting properties:
All the integers in the array were between
l
and
r
(inclusive).
The sum of all the elements was divisible by
3
.
Unfortunately, Ayoub has lost his array, but he remembers the size of the array
n
and the numbers
l
and
r
, so he asked you to find the number of ways to restore the array.
Since the answer could be very large, print it modulo
10
9
+7
(i.e. the remainder when dividing by
10
9
+7
). In case there are no satisfying arrays (Ayoub has a wrong memory), print
0
.
Input
The first and only line contains three integers
n
,
l
and
r
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,1≤l≤r≤
10
9
) — the size of the lost array and the range of numbers in the array.
Output
Print the remainder when dividing by
10
9
+7
the number of ways to restore the array.

Note
In the first example, the possible arrays are :
[1,2],[2,1],[3,3]
.
In the second example, the only possible array is
[2,2,2]
.
