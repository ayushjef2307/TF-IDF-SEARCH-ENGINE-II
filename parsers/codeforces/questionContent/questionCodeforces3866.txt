Salem gave you
n
sticks with integer positive lengths
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
.
For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from
a
to
b
is
|a−b|
, where
|x|
means the absolute value of
x
.
A stick length
a
i
is called almost good for some integer
t
if
|
a
i
−t|≤1
.
Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer
t
and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of
t
is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer.
As an answer, print the value of
t
and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for
t
, print any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤1000
) — the number of sticks.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤100
) — the lengths of the sticks.
Output
Print the value of
t
and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for
t
, print any of them.

Note
In the first example, we can change
1
into
2
and
10
into
4
with cost
|1−2|+|10−4|=1+6=7
and the resulting lengths
[2,4,4]
are almost good for
t=3
.
In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for
t=2
, so we don't have to do anything.
