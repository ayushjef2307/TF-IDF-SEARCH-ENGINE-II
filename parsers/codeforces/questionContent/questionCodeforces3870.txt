Cardbluff is popular sport game in Telegram. Each Cardbluff player has ever dreamed about entrance in the professional layer. There are
n
judges now in the layer and you are trying to pass the entrance exam. You have a number
k
— your skill in Cardbluff.
Each judge has a number
a
i
— an indicator of uncertainty about your entrance to the professional layer and a number
e
i
— an experience playing Cardbluff. To pass the exam you need to convince all judges by playing with them. You can play only one game with each judge. As a result of a particular game, you can divide the uncertainty of
i
-th judge by any natural divisor of
a
i
which is at most
k
. If GCD of all indicators is equal to
1
, you will enter to the professional layer and become a judge.
Also, you want to minimize the total amount of spent time. So, if you play with
x
judges with total experience
y
you will spend
x⋅y
seconds.
Print minimal time to enter to the professional layer or
−1
if it's impossible.
Input
There are two numbers in the first line
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤
10
6
,
1≤k≤
10
12
) — the number of judges and your skill in Cardbluff.
The second line contains
n
integers, where
i
-th number
a
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
12
) — the uncertainty of
i
-th judge
The third line contains
n
integers in the same format (
1≤
e
i
≤
10
9
),
e
i
— the experience of
i
-th judge.
Output
Print the single integer — minimal number of seconds to pass exam, or
−1
if it's impossible
