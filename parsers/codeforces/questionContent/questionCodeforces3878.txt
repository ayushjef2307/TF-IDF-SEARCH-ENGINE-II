inputstandard input
outputstandard output
You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integer numbers.
You have to color this array in
k
colors in such a way that:
Each element of the array should be colored in some color;
For each
i
from
1
to
k
there should be at least one element colored in the
i
-th color in the array;
For each
i
from
1
to
k
all elements colored in the
i
-th color should be distinct.
Obviously, such coloring might be impossible. In this case, print "NO". Otherwise print "YES" and any coloring (i.e. numbers
c
1
,
c
2
,…
c
n
, where
1≤
c
i
≤k
and
c
i
is the color of the
i
-th element of the given array) satisfying the conditions above. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤5000
) — the length of the array
a
and the number of colors, respectively.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤5000
) — elements of the array
a
.
Output
If there is no answer, print "NO". Otherwise print "YES" and any coloring (i.e. numbers
c
1
,
c
2
,…
c
n
, where
1≤
c
i
≤k
and
c
i
is the color of the
i
-th element of the given array) satisfying the conditions described in the problem statement. If there are multiple answers, you can print any.

Note
In the first example the answer
2 1 2 1
is also acceptable.
