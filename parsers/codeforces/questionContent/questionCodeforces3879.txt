You are given an integer sequence
1,2,…,n
. You have to divide it into two sets
A
and
B
in such a way that each element belongs to exactly one set and
|sum(A)−sum(B)|
is minimum possible.
The value
|x|
is the absolute value of
x
and
sum(S)
is the sum of elements of the set
S
.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
9
).
Output
Print one integer — the minimum possible value of
|sum(A)−sum(B)|
if you divide the initial sequence
1,2,…,n
into two sets
A
and
B
.

Note
Some (not all) possible answers to examples:
In the first example you can divide the initial sequence into sets
A={1,2}
and
B={3}
so the answer is
0
.
In the second example you can divide the initial sequence into sets
A={1,3,4}
and
B={2,5}
so the answer is
1
.
In the third example you can divide the initial sequence into sets
A={1,4,5}
and
B={2,3,6}
so the answer is
1
.
