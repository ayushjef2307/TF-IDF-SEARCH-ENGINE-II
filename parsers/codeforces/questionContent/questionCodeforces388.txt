Consider a permutation
†
†
p
of length
3n
. Each time you can do one of the following operations:
Sort the first
2n
elements in increasing order.
Sort the last
2n
elements in increasing order.
We can show that every permutation can be made sorted in increasing order using only these operations. Let's call
f(p)
the minimum number of these operations needed to make the permutation
p
sorted in increasing order.
Given
n
, find the sum of
f(p)
over all
(3n)!
permutations
p
of size
3n
.
Since the answer could be very large, output it modulo a prime
M
.
†
†
A permutation of length
n
is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array), and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
The only line of input contains two numbers
n
and
M
(
1≤n≤
10
6
,
10
8
≤M≤
10
9
). It is guaranteed that
M
is a prime number.
Output
Output the answer modulo
M
.

Note
In the first test case, all the permutations are:
[1,2,3]
, which requires
0
operations;
[1,3,2]
, which requires
1
operation;
[2,1,3]
, which requires
1
operation;
[2,3,1]
, which requires
2
operations;
[3,1,2]
, which requires
2
operations;
[3,2,1]
, which requires
3
operations.
Therefore, the answer is
0+1+1+2+2+3=9
.
