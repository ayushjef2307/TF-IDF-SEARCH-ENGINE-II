Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw
n
squares in the snow with a side length of
1
. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length
1
, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.
In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends
(x,y)
and
(x,y+1)
. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends
(
x
′
,y)
and
(
x
′
,y+1)
for some
x
′
. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates
x
,
x+1
and the differing coordinate
y
.
For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:
After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:
If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:
After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:
Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.
Input
The only line of input contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
9
), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.
Output
Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw
n
squares in the manner described above.
