Fedya loves problems involving data structures. Especially ones about different queries on subsegments. Fedya had a nice array
a
1
,
a
2
,…
a
n
and a beautiful data structure. This data structure, given
l
and
r
,
1≤l≤r≤n
, could find the greatest integer
d
, such that
d
divides each of
a
l
,
a
l+1
, ...,
a
r
.
Fedya really likes this data structure, so he applied it to every non-empty contiguous subarray of array
a
, put all answers into the array and sorted it. He called this array
b
. It's easy to see that array
b
contains
n(n+1)/2
elements.
After that, Fedya implemented another cool data structure, that allowed him to find sum
b
l
+
b
l+1
+…+
b
r
for given
l
and
r
,
1≤l≤r≤n(n+1)/2
. Surely, Fedya applied this data structure to every contiguous subarray of array
b
, called the result
c
and sorted it. Help Fedya find the lower median of array
c
.
Recall that for a sorted array of length
k
the lower median is an element at position
⌊
k+1
2
⌋
, if elements of the array are enumerated starting from
1
. For example, the lower median of array
(1,1,2,3,6)
is
2
, and the lower median of
(0,17,23,96)
is
17
.
Input
First line contains a single integer
n
 — number of elements in array
a
(
1≤n≤50000
).
Second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
 — elements of the array (
1≤
a
i
≤100000
).
Output
Print a single integer — the lower median of array
c
.

Note
In the first sample array
b
is equal to
3,3,6
, then array
c
is equal to
3,3,6,6,9,12
, so the lower median is
6
.
In the second sample
b
is
8,8,8
,
c
is
8,8,8,16,16,24
, so the lower median is
8
.
