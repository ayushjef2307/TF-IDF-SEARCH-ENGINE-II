You are given an array
a
of
n
integers.
Find two permutations
†
†
p
and
q
of length
n
such that
max(
p
i
,
q
i
)=
a
i
for all
1≤i≤n
or report that such
p
and
q
do not exist.
†
†
A permutation of length
n
is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array), and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
) — the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the total sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, if there do not exist
p
and
q
that satisfy the conditions, output "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes) and then output
2
lines. The first line should contain
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
and the second line should contain
n
integers
q
1
,
q
2
,…,
q
n
.
If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
In the first test case,
p=q=[1]
. It is correct since
a
1
=max(
p
1
,
q
1
)=1
.
In the second test case,
p=[1,3,4,2,5]
and
q=[5,2,3,1,4]
. It is correct since:
a
1
=max(
p
1
,
q
1
)=max(1,5)=5
,
a
2
=max(
p
2
,
q
2
)=max(3,2)=3
,
a
3
=max(
p
3
,
q
3
)=max(4,3)=4
,
a
4
=max(
p
4
,
q
4
)=max(2,1)=2
,
a
5
=max(
p
5
,
q
5
)=max(5,4)=5
.
In the third test case, one can show that no such
p
and
q
exist.
