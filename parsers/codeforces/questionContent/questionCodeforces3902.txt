Mitya has a rooted tree with
n
vertices indexed from
1
to
n
, where the root has index
1
. Each vertex
v
initially had an integer number
a
v
≥0
written on it. For every vertex
v
Mitya has computed
s
v
: the sum of all values written on the vertices on the path from vertex
v
to the root, as well as
h
v
 — the depth of vertex
v
, which denotes the number of vertices on the path from vertex
v
to the root. Clearly,
s
1
=
a
1
and
h
1
=1
.
Then Mitya erased all numbers
a
v
, and by accident he also erased all values
s
v
for vertices with even depth (vertices with even
h
v
). Your task is to restore the values
a
v
for every vertex, or determine that Mitya made a mistake. In case there are multiple ways to restore the values, you're required to find one which minimizes the total sum of values
a
v
for all vertices in the tree.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
 — the number of vertices in the tree (
2≤n≤
10
5
). The following line contains integers
p
2
,
p
3
, ...
p
n
, where
p
i
stands for the parent of vertex with index
i
in the tree (
1≤
p
i
<i
). The last line contains integer values
s
1
,
s
2
, ...,
s
n
(
−1≤
s
v
≤
10
9
), where erased values are replaced by
−1
.
Output
Output one integer — the minimum total sum of all values
a
v
in the original tree, or
−1
if such tree does not exist.
