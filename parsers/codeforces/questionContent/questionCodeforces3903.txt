A Thue-Morse-Radecki-Mateusz sequence (Thorse-Radewoosh sequence in short) is an infinite sequence constructed from a finite sequence
gen
of length
d
and an integer
m
, obtained in the following sequence of steps:
In the beginning, we define the one-element sequence
M
0
=(0)
.
In the
k
-th step,
k≥1
, we define the sequence
M
k
to be the concatenation of the
d
copies of
M
k−1
. However, each of them is altered slightly — in the
i
-th of them (
1≤i≤d
), each element
x
is changed to
(x+
gen
i
)(modm)
.
For instance, if we pick
gen=(0,1,2)
and
m=4
:
M
0
=(0)
,
M
1
=(0,1,2)
,
M
2
=(0,1,2,1,2,3,2,3,0)
,
M
3
=(0,1,2,1,2,3,2,3,0,1,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,1,2,3,0,3,0,1,0,1,2)
, and so on.
As you can see, as long as the first element of
gen
is
0
, each consecutive step produces a sequence whose prefix is the sequence generated in the previous step. Therefore, we can define the infinite Thorse-Radewoosh sequence
M
∞
as the sequence obtained by applying the step above indefinitely. For the parameters above,
M
∞
=(0,1,2,1,2,3,2,3,0,1,2,3,2,3,0,3,0,1,…)
.
Mateusz picked a sequence
gen
and an integer
m
, and used them to obtain a Thorse-Radewoosh sequence
M
∞
. He then picked two integers
l
,
r
, and wrote down a subsequence of this sequence
A:=((
M
∞
)
l
,(
M
∞
)
l+1
,…,(
M
∞
)
r
)
.
Note that we use the
1
-based indexing both for
M
∞
and
A
.
Mateusz has his favorite sequence
B
with length
n
, and would like to see how large it is compared to
A
. Let's say that
B
majorizes sequence
X
of length
n
(let's denote it as
B≥X
) if and only if for all
i∈{1,2,…,n}
, we have
B
i
≥
X
i
.
He now asks himself how many integers
x
in the range
[1,|A|−n+1]
there are such that
B≥(
A
x
,
A
x+1
,
A
x+2
,…,
A
x+n−1
)
. As both sequences were huge, answering the question using only his pen and paper turned out to be too time-consuming. Can you help him automate his research?
Input
The first line contains two integers
d
and
m
(
2≤d≤20
,
2≤m≤60
) — the length of the sequence
gen
and an integer used to perform the modular operations. The second line contains
d
integers
gen
i
(
0≤
gen
i
<m
). It's guaranteed that the first element of the sequence
gen
is equal to zero.
The third line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤30000
) — the length of the sequence
B
. The fourth line contains
n
integers
B
i
(
0≤
B
i
<m
). The fifth line contains two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤
10
18
,
r−l+1≥n
).

is as follows:
