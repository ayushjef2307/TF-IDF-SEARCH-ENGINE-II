All bus tickets in Berland have their numbers. A number consists of
n
digits (
n
is even). Only
k
decimal digits
d
1
,
d
2
,…,
d
k
can be used to form ticket numbers. If
0
is among these digits, then numbers may have leading zeroes. For example, if
n=4
and only digits
0
and
4
can be used, then
0000
,
4004
,
4440
are valid ticket numbers, and
0002
,
00
,
44443
are not.
A ticket is lucky if the sum of first
n/2
digits is equal to the sum of remaining
n/2
digits.
Calculate the number of different lucky tickets in Berland. Since the answer may be big, print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(2≤n≤2⋅
10

,1≤k≤10)
— the number of digits in each ticket number, and the number of different decimal digits that may be used.
n
is even.
The second line contains a sequence of pairwise distinct integers
d

,…,
d
k
(0≤

8118
,
8181
and
