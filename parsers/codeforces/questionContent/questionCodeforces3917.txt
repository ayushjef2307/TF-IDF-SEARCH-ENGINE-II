You are given a range of positive integers from
l
to
r
.
Find such a pair of integers
(x,y)
that
l≤x,y≤r
,
x≠y
and
x
divides
y
.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
You are also asked to answer
T
independent queries.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
T
(
1≤T≤1000
) — the number of queries.
Each of the next
T
lines contains two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤998244353
) — inclusive borders of the range.
It is guaranteed that testset only includes queries, which have at least one suitable pair.
Output
Print
T
lines, each line should contain the answer — two integers
x
and
y
such that
l≤x,y≤r
,
x≠y
and
x
divides
y
. The answer in the
i
-th line should correspond to the
i
-th query from the input.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
