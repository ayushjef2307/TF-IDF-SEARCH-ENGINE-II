You are given an integer
k
. Find the largest integer
x
, where
1≤x<k
, such that
x!+(x−1)
!
†
is a multiple of
‡
‡
k
, or determine that no such
x
exists.
†
†
y!
denotes the factorial of
y
, which is defined recursively as
y!=y⋅(y−1)!
for
y≥1
with the base case of
0!=1
. For example,
5!=5⋅4⋅3⋅2⋅1⋅0!=120
.
‡
‡
If
a
and
b
are integers, then
a
is a multiple of
b
if there exists an integer
c
such that
a=b⋅c
. For example,
10
is a multiple of
5
but
9
is not a multiple of
6
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
k
(
2≤k≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case output a single integer — the largest possible integer
x
that satisfies the conditions above.
If no such
x
exists, output
−1
.

Note
In the first test case,
2!+1!=2+1=3
, which is a multiple of
3
.
In the third test case,
7!+6!=5040+720=5760
, which is a multiple of
8
.
