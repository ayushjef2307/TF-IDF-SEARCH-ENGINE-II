You are given an array
a
of
n
points in
k
-dimensional space. Let the distance between two points
a
x
and
a
y
be
∑
i=1
k
|
a
x,i
−
a
y,i
|
(it is also known as Manhattan distance).
You have to process
q
queries of the following two types:
1
i
b
1
b
2
...
b
k
— set
i
-th element of
a
to the point
(
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
k
)
;
2
l
r
— find the maximum distance between two points
a
i
and
a
j
, where
l≤i,j≤r
.
Input
The first line contains two numbers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤k≤5
) — the number of elements in
a
and the number of dimensions of the space, respectively.
Then
n
lines follow, each containing
k
integers
a
i,1
,
a
i,2
, ...,
a
i,k
(
−
10
6
≤
a
i,j
≤
10
6
) — the coordinates of
i
-th point.
The next line contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of queries.
Then
q
lines follow, each denoting a query. There are two types of queries:
1
i
b
1
b
2
...
b
k
(
1≤i≤n
,
−
10
6
≤
b
j
≤
10
6
) — set
i
-th element of
a
to the point
(
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
k
)
;
2
l
r
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) — find the maximum distance between two points
a
i
and
a
j
, where
l≤i,j≤r
.
There is at least one query of the second type.
Output
Print the answer for each query of the second type.
