Let
n
be an integer. Consider all permutations on integers
1
to
n
in lexicographic order, and concatenate them into one big sequence
p
. For example, if
n=3
, then
p=[1,2,3,1,3,2,2,1,3,2,3,1,3,1,2,3,2,1]
. The length of this sequence will be
n⋅n!
.
Let
1≤i≤j≤n⋅n!
be a pair of indices. We call the sequence
(
p
i
,
p
i+1
,…,
p
j−1
,
p
j
)
a subarray of
p
. Its length is defined as the number of its elements, i.e.,
j−i+1
. Its sum is the sum of all its elements, i.e.,
∑
j
k=i
p
k
.
You are given
n
. Find the number of subarrays of
p
of length
n
having sum
n(n+1)
2
. Since this number may be large, output it modulo
998244353
(a prime number).
Input
The only line contains one integer
n
 (
1≤n≤
10
6
), as described in the problem statement.
Output
Output a single integer — the number of subarrays of length
n
having sum
n(n+1)
2
, modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first sample, there are
16
subarrays of length
3
. In order of appearance, they are:
