2
n
teams participate in a playoff tournament. The tournament consists of
2
n
−1
games. They are held as follows: in the first phase of the tournament, the teams are split into pairs: team
1
plays against team
2
, team
3
plays against team
4
, and so on (so,
2
n−1
games are played in that phase). When a team loses a game, it is eliminated, and each game results in elimination of one team (there are no ties). After that, only
2
n−1
teams remain. If only one team remains, it is declared the champion; otherwise, the second phase begins, where
2
n−2
games are played: in the first one of them, the winner of the game "
1
vs
2
" plays against the winner of the game "
3
vs
4
", then the winner of the game "
5
vs
6
" plays against the winner of the game "
7
vs
8
", and so on. This process repeats until only one team remains.
The skill level of the
i
-th team is
p
i
, where
p
is a permutation of integers
1
,
2
, ...,
2
n
(a permutation is an array where each element from
1
to
2
n
occurs exactly once).
You are given a string
s
which consists of
n
characters. These characters denote the results of games in each phase of the tournament as follows:
if
s
i
is equal to 0, then during the
i
-th phase (the phase with
2
n−i
games), in each match, the team with the lower skill level wins;
if
s
i
is equal to 1, then during the
i
-th phase (the phase with
2
n−i
games), in each match, the team with the higher skill level wins.
Let's say that an integer
x
is winning if it is possible to find a permutation
p
such that the team with skill
x
wins the tournament. Find all winning integers.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤18
).
The second line contains the string
s
of length
n
consisting of the characters 0 and/or 1.
Output
Print all the winning integers
x
in ascending order.
