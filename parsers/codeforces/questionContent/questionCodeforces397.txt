inputstandard input
outputstandard output
There are
n
block towers, numbered from
1
to
n
. The
i
-th tower consists of
a
i
blocks.
In one move, you can move one block from tower
i
to tower
j
, but only if
a
i
>
a
j
. That move increases
a
j
by
1
and decreases
a
i
by
1
. You can perform as many moves as you would like (possibly, zero).
What's the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower
1
after the moves?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of towers.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the number of blocks on each tower.
The sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each testcase, print the largest amount of blocks you can have on the tower
1
after you make any number of moves (possibly, zero).

Note
In the first testcase, you can move a block from tower
2
to tower
1
, making the block counts
[2,1,3]
. Then move a block from tower
3
to tower
1
, making the block counts
[3,1,2]
. Tower
1
has
3
blocks in it, and you can't obtain a larger amount.
In the second testcase, you can move a block from any of towers
2
or
3
to tower
1
, so that it has
2
blocks in it.
In the third testcase, you can
500000000
times move a block from tower
2
to tower
1
. After that the block countes will be
[500000001,500000000]
.
