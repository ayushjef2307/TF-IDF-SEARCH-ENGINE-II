The Fair Nut found a string
s
. The string consists of lowercase Latin letters. The Nut is a curious guy, so he wants to find the number of strictly increasing sequences
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
k
, such that:
For each
i
(
1≤i≤k
),
s
p
i
=
'a'.
For each
i
(
1≤i<k
), there is such
j
that
p
i
<j<
p
i+1
and
s
j
=
'b'.
The Nut is upset because he doesn't know how to find the number. Help him.
This number should be calculated modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The first line contains the string
s
(
1≤|s|≤
10
5
) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Output
In a single line print the answer to the problem — the number of such sequences
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
k
modulo
10
9
+7
.
