The Fair Nut lives in
n
story house.
a
i
people live on the
i
-th floor of the house. Every person uses elevator twice a day: to get from the floor where he/she lives to the ground (first) floor and to get from the first floor to the floor where he/she lives, when he/she comes back home in the evening.
It was decided that elevator, when it is not used, will stay on the
x
-th floor, but
x
hasn't been chosen yet. When a person needs to get from floor
a
to floor
b
, elevator follows the simple algorithm:
Moves from the
x
-th floor (initially it stays on the
x
-th floor) to the
a
-th and takes the passenger.
Moves from the
a
-th floor to the
b
-th floor and lets out the passenger (if
a
equals
b
, elevator just opens and closes the doors, but still comes to the floor from the
x
-th floor).
Moves from the
b
-th floor back to the
x
-th.
The elevator never transposes more than one person and always goes back to the floor
x
before transposing a next passenger. The elevator spends one unit of electricity to move between neighboring floors. So moving from the
a
-th floor to the
b
-th floor requires
|a−b|
units of electricity.
Your task is to help Nut to find the minimum number of electricity units, that it would be enough for one day, by choosing an optimal the
x
-th floor. Don't forget than elevator initially stays on the
x
-th floor.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the number of floors.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤100
) — the number of people on each floor.
Output
In a single line, print the answer to the problem — the minimum number of electricity units.

Note
In the first example, the answer can be achieved by choosing the second floor as the
x
-th floor. Each person from the second floor (there are two of them) would spend
4
units of electricity per day (
2
to get down and
2
to get up), and one person from the third would spend
8
units of electricity per day (
4
to get down and
4
to get up).
4⋅2+8⋅1=16
.
In the second example, the answer can be achieved by choosing the first floor as the
x
-th floor.
