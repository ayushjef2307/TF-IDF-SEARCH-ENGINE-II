The Fair Nut got stacked in planar world. He should solve this task to get out.
You are given
n
rectangles with vertexes in
(0,0)
,
(
x
i
,0)
,
(

)
,
(0,

i
)
. For each rectangle, you are also given a number
a
i
. Choose some of them that the area of union minus sum of
a
i
of the chosen ones is maximum.
It is guaranteed that there are no nested rectangles.
Nut has no idea how to find the answer, so he asked for your help.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
6
) — the number of rectangles.
Each of the next
n
lines contains three integers
x
i
,
y

and
a
i
(

).
It is guaranteed that there are no nested rectangles.
Output
In a single line print the answer to the problem — the maximum value which you can achieve.

Note
In the first example, the right answer can be achieved by choosing the first and the second rectangles.
In the second example, the right answer can also be achieved by choosing the first and the second rectangles.
