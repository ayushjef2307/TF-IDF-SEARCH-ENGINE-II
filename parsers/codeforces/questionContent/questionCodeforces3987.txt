After learning some fancy algorithms about palindromes, Chouti found palindromes very interesting, so he wants to challenge you with this problem.
Chouti has got two strings
A
and
B
. Since he likes palindromes, he would like to pick
a
as some non-empty palindromic substring of
A
and
b
as some non-empty palindromic substring of
B
. Concatenating them, he will get string
ab
.
Chouti thinks strings he could get this way are interesting, so he wants to know how many different strings he can get.
Input
The first line contains a single string
A
(
1≤|A|≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line contains a single string
B
(
1≤|B|≤2⋅
10
5
).
Strings
A
and
B
contain only lowercase English letters.
Output
The first and only line should contain a single integer — the number of possible strings.

Note
In the first example, attainable strings are
"a" + "a" = "aa",
"aa" + "a" = "aaa",
"aa" + "aba" = "aaaba",
"aa" + "b" = "aab",
"a" + "aba" = "aaba",
"a" + "b" = "ab".
In the second example, attainable strings are "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", "aaaba", "aab", "aaba", "ab", "abaa", "abaaa", "abaaba", "abab", "ba", "baa", "baba", "bb".
Notice that though "a"+"aa"="aa"+"a"="aaa", "aaa" will only be counted once.
