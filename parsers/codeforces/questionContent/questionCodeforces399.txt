You are given a graph consisting of
n
vertices and
m
directed arcs. The
i
-th arc goes from the vertex
x
i
to the vertex
y
i
, has capacity
c
i
and weight
w
i
. No arc goes into the vertex
1
, and no arc goes from the vertex
n
. There are no cycles of negative weight in the graph (it is impossible to travel from any vertex to itself in such a way that the total weight of all arcs you go through is negative).
You have to assign each arc a flow (an integer between
0
and its capacity, inclusive). For every vertex except
1
and
n
, the total flow on the arcs going to this vertex must be equal to the total flow on the arcs going from that vertex. Let the flow on the
i
-th arc be
f
i
, then the cost of the flow is equal to
∑
i=1
m
f
i
w
i
. You have to find a flow which minimizes the cost.
Sounds classical, right? Well, we have some additional constraints on the flow on every edge:
if
c
i
is even,
f
i
must be even;
if
c
i
is odd,
f
i
must be odd.
Can you solve this problem?
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤100
;
1≤m≤200
).
Then
m
lines follow. The
i
-th of them contains four integers
x
i
,
y
i
,
c
i
, and
w
i
(
1≤
x
i
≤n−1
;
2≤
y
i
≤n
;
x
i
≠
y
i
;
1≤
c
i
≤100
;
−100≤
w
i
≤100
). These integers describe the
i
-th arc.
Additional constraints on the input:
there are no negative cycles in the graph.
Output
If a flow satisfying all of the constraints does not exist, print Impossible.
Otherwise, print two lines:
the first line should contain one word Possible;
the second line should contain
m
integers
f
1
,
f
2
,…,
f
m
.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them. Note that the cost of the flow should be minimized.
