Chouti was doing a competitive programming competition. However, after having all the problems accepted, he got bored and decided to invent some small games.
He came up with the following game. The player has a positive integer
n
. Initially the value of
n
equals to
v
and the player is able to do the following operation as many times as the player want (possibly zero): choose a positive integer
x
that
x<n
and
x
is not a divisor of
n
, then subtract
x
from
n
. The goal of the player is to minimize the value of
n
in the end.
Soon, Chouti found the game trivial. Can you also beat the game?
Input
The input contains only one integer in the first line:
v
(
1≤v≤
10
9
), the initial value of
n
.
Output
Output a single integer, the minimum value of
n
the player can get.

Note
In the first example, the player can choose
x=3
in the first turn, then
n
becomes
5
. He can then choose
x=4
in the second turn to get
n=1
as the result. There are other ways to get this minimum. However, for example, he cannot choose
x=2
in the first turn because
2
is a divisor of
8
.
In the second example, since
n=1
initially, the player can do nothing.
