Let's name a pair of positive integers
(x,y)
lucky if the greatest common divisor of them is equal to
1
(
gcd(x,y)=1
).
Let's define a chain induced by
(x,y)
as a sequence of pairs
(x,y)
,
(x+1,y+1)
,
(x+2,y+2)
,
…
,
(x+k,y+k)
for some integer
k≥0
. The length of the chain is the number of pairs it consists of, or
(k+1)
.
Let's name such chain lucky if all pairs in the chain are lucky.
You are given
n
pairs
(
x
i
,
y
i
)
. Calculate for each pair the length of the longest lucky chain induced by this pair. Note that if
(
x
i
,
y
i
)
is not lucky itself, the chain will have the length
0
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
6
) — the number of pairs.
Next
n
lines contains
n
pairs — one per line. The
i
-th line contains two integers
x
i
and
y
i
(
1≤
x
i
<
y
i
≤
10
7
) — the corresponding pair.
Output
Print
n
integers, where the
i
-th integer is the length of the longest lucky chain induced by
(
x
i
,
y
i
)
or
−1
if the chain can be infinitely long.

Note
In the first test case,
gcd(5,15)=5>1
, so it's already not lucky, so the length of the lucky chain is
0
.
In the second test case,
gcd(13+1,37+1)=gcd(14,38)=2
. So, the lucky chain consists of the single pair
(13,37)
.
