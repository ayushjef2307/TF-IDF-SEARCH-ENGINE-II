Vasya has a tree consisting of
n
vertices with root in vertex
1
. At first all vertices has
0
written on it.
Let
d(i,j)
be the distance between vertices
i
and
j
, i.e. number of edges in the shortest path from
i
to
j
. Also, let's denote
k
-subtree of vertex
x
— set of vertices
y
such that next two conditions are met:
x
is the ancestor of
y
(each vertex is the ancestor of itself);
d(x,y)≤k
.
Vasya needs you to process
m
queries. The
i
-th query is a triple
v
i
,
d
i
and
x
i
. For each query Vasya adds value
x
i
to each vertex from
d
i
-subtree of
v
i
.
Report to Vasya all values, written on vertices of the tree after processing all queries.
Input
The first line contains single integer
n
(
1≤n≤3⋅
10
5
) — number of vertices in the tree.
Each of next
n−1
lines contains two integers
x
and
y
(
1≤x,y≤n
) — edge between vertices
x
and
y
. It is guarantied that given graph is a tree.
Next line contains single integer
m
(
1≤m≤3⋅
10
5
) — number of queries.
Each of next
m
lines contains three integers
v
i
,
d

) — description of the
i
-th query.
Output
Print
n
integers. The
i
-th integers is the value, written in the
i
-th vertex after processing all queries.

Note
In the first exapmle initial values in vertices are
0,0,0,0,0
. After the first query values will be equal to
1,1,1,0,0
. After the second query values will be equal to
1,11,1,0,0
. After the third query values will be equal to
1,11,1,100,0
.
