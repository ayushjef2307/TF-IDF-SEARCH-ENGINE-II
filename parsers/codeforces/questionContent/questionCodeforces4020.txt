You are given two integers
l
and
r
(
l≤r
). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from
l
to
r
(including
l
and
r
) such that each number contains at most
k
different digits, and print this sum modulo
998244353
.
For example, if
k=1
then you have to calculate all numbers from
l
to
r
such that each number is formed using only one digit. For
l=10,r=50
the answer is
11+22+33+44=110
.
Input
The only line of the input contains three integers
l
,
r
and
k
(
1≤l≤r<
10
18
,1≤k≤10
) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.
Output
Print one integer — the sum of numbers from
l
to
r
such that each number contains at most
k
different digits, modulo
998244353
.

Note
For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from
l
to
r
which equals to
50⋅51

−
9⋅10

=1230
. This example also explained in the problem statement but for
k=1
.
For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from
l
to
r
which equals to
2345⋅2346

For the third example the answer is
101+110+111+112+113+114+115+116+117+118+119+121+122+131+133+141+144+151=2189
