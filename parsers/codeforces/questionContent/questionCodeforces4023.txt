Vasya has got
n
books, numbered from
1
to
n
, arranged in a stack. The topmost book has number
a
1
, the next one —
a
2
, and so on. The book at the bottom of the stack has number
a
n
. All numbers are distinct.
Vasya wants to move all the books to his backpack in
n
steps. During
i
-th step he wants to move the book number
b
i
into his backpack. If the book with number
b
i
is in the stack, he takes this book and all the books above the book
b
i
, and puts them into the backpack; otherwise he does nothing and begins the next step. For example, if books are arranged in the order
[1,2,3]
(book
1
is the topmost), and Vasya moves the books in the order
[2,1,3]
, then during the first step he will move two books (
1
and
2
), during the second step he will do nothing (since book
1
is already in the backpack), and during the third step — one book (the book number
3
). Note that
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
are distinct.
Help Vasya! Tell him the number of books he will put into his backpack during each step.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n (1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
)
— the number of books in the stack.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
 (1≤
a
i
≤n)
denoting the stack of books.
The third line contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
 (1≤
b
i
≤n)
denoting the steps Vasya is going to perform.
All numbers
a
1
…
a
n
are distinct, the same goes for
b
1
…
b
n
.
Output
Print
n
integers. The
i
-th of them should be equal to the number of books Vasya moves to his backpack during the
i
-th step.

Note
The first example is described in the statement.
In the second example, during the first step Vasya will move the books
[3,1,4]
. After that only books
2
and
5
remain in the stack (
2
is above
5
). During the second step Vasya will take the books
2
and
5
. After that the stack becomes empty, so during next steps Vasya won't move any books.
