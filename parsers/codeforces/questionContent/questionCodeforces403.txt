You want to type the string
s
, consisting of
n
lowercase Latin letters, using your favorite text editor Notepad#.
Notepad# supports two kinds of operations:
append any letter to the end of the string;
copy a continuous substring of an already typed string and paste this substring to the end of the string.
Can you type string
s
in strictly less than
n
operations?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the string
s
.
The second line contains a string
s
, consisting of
n
lowercase Latin letters.
The sum of
n
doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
over all testcases.
Output
For each testcase, print "YES" if you can type string
s
in strictly less than
n
operations. Otherwise, print "NO".

Note
In the first testcase, you can start with typing "codef" (
5
operations), then copy "o" (
1
operation) from an already typed part, then finish with typing "rces" (
4
operations). That will be
10
operations, which is not strictly less than
n
. There exist other ways to type "codeforces". However, no matter what you do, you can't do less than
n
operations.
In the second testcase, you can type "labac" (
5
operations), then copy "aba" (
1
operation), finishing the string in
6
operations.
