Let's define rank of undirected graph as rank of its adjacency matrix in
R
n×n
.
Given a tree. Each edge of this tree will be deleted with probability
1/2
, all these deletions are independent. Let
E
be the expected rank of resulting forest. Find
E⋅
2
n−1
modulo
998244353
(it is easy to show that
E⋅
2
n−1
is an integer).
Input
First line of input contains
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
) — number of vertices.
Next
n−1
lines contains two integers
u
v
(
1≤u,v≤n;u≠v
) — indices of vertices connected by edge.
It is guaranteed that given graph is a tree.
Output
Print one integer — answer to the problem.
