You are given a positive integer
x
.
You can apply the following operation to the number: remove one occurrence of any digit in such a way that the resulting number does not contain any leading zeroes and is still a positive integer. For example,
10142
can be converted to
1142
,
1042
,
1012
or
1014
(note that
0142
is not a valid outcome);
10
can be converted to
1
(but not to
0
since it is not positive).
Your task is to find the minimum positive integer that you can obtain from
x
if you can apply the aforementioned operation exactly
k
times.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
x
(
1≤x<
10
500000
).
The second line contains a single integer
k
(
0≤k<|x|
), where
|x|
is the length of the number
x
.
The sum of
|x|
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum positive number that you can obtain from
x
if you can apply the operation exactly
k
times.
