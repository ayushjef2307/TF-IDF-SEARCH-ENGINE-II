You are given a positive integer
n
greater or equal to
2
. For every pair of integers
a
and
b
(
2≤|a|,|b|≤n
), you can transform
a
into
b
if and only if there exists an integer
x
such that
1<|x|
and (
a⋅x=b
or
b⋅x=a
), where
|x|
denotes the absolute value of
x
.
After such a transformation, your score increases by
|x|
points and you are not allowed to transform
a
into
b
nor
b
into
a
anymore.
Initially, you have a score of
0
. You can start at any integer and transform it as many times as you like. What is the maximum score you can achieve?
Input
A single line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤100000
) — the given integer described above.
Output
Print an only integer — the maximum score that can be achieved with the transformations. If it is not possible to perform even a single transformation for all possible starting integers, print
0
.

Note
In the first example, the transformations are
2→4→(−2)→(−4)→2
.
In the third example, it is impossible to perform even a single transformation.
