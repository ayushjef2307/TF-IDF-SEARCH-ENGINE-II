JATC's math teacher always gives the class some interesting math problems so that they don't get bored. Today the problem is as follows. Given an integer
n
, you can perform the following operations zero or more times:
mul
x
: multiplies
n
by
x
(where
x
is an arbitrary positive integer).
sqrt: replaces
n
with
n
−
−
√
(to apply this operation,
n
−
−
√
must be an integer).
You can perform these operations as many times as you like. What is the minimum value of
n
, that can be achieved and what is the minimum number of operations, to achieve that minimum value?
Apparently, no one in the class knows the answer to this problem, maybe you can help them?
Input
The only line of the input contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
6
) — the initial number.
Output
Print two integers: the minimum integer
n
that can be achieved using the described operations and the minimum number of operations required.

Note
In the first example, you can apply the operation mul
5
to get
100
and then sqrt to get
10
.
In the second example, you can first apply sqrt to get
72
, then mul
18
to get
1296
and finally two more sqrt and you get
6
.
Note, that even if the initial value of
n
is less or equal
10
6
, it can still become greater than
10
6
after applying one or more operations.
