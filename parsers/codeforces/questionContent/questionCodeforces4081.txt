There is a strip with an infinite number of cells. Cells are numbered starting with
0
. Initially the cell
i
contains a ball with the number
i
.
There are
n
pockets located at cells
a
1
,…,
a
n
. Each cell contains at most one pocket.
Filtering is the following sequence of operations:
All pockets at cells
a
1
,…,
a
n
open simultaneously, which makes balls currently located at those cells disappear. After the balls disappear, the pockets close again.
For each cell
i
from
0
to
∞
, if the cell
i
contains a ball, we move that ball to the free cell
j
with the lowest number. If there is no free cell
j<i
, the ball stays at the cell
i
.
Note that after each filtering operation each cell will still contain exactly one ball.
For example, let the cells
1
,
3
and
4
contain pockets. The initial configuration of balls is shown below (underscores display the cells with pockets):
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...
After opening and closing the pockets, balls 1, 3 and 4 disappear:
0   2     5 6 7 8 9 ...
After moving all the balls to the left, the configuration looks like this:
0 2 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ...
Another filtering repetition results in the following:
0 5 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 ...
You have to answer
m
questions. The
i
-th of these questions is "what is the number of the ball located at the cell
x
i
after
k
i
repetitions of the filtering operation?"
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
 — the number of pockets and questions respectively (
1≤n,m≤
10
5
).
The following line contains
n
integers
a
1
,…,
a
n
 — the numbers of cells containing pockets (
0≤
a
1
<…<
a
n
≤
10
9
).
The following
m
lines describe questions. The
i
-th of these lines contains two integers
x
i
and
k
i
(
0≤
x
i
,
k
i
≤
10
9
).
