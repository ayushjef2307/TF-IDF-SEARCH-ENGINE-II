You are given a positive integer
n
.
Let
S(x)
be sum of digits in base 10 representation of
x
, for example,
S(123)=1+2+3=6
,
S(0)=0
.
Your task is to find two integers
a,b
, such that
0≤a,b≤n
,
a+b=n
and
S(a)+S(b)
is the largest possible among all such pairs.
Input
The only line of input contains an integer
n
(1≤n≤
10
12
)
.
Output
Print largest
S(a)+S(b)
among all pairs of integers
a,b
, such that
0≤a,b≤n
and
a+b=n
.

Note
In the first example, you can choose, for example,
a=17
and
b=18
, so that
S(17)+S(18)=1+7+1+8=17
. It can be shown that it is impossible to get a larger answer.
In the second test example, you can choose, for example,
a=5000000001
and
b=4999999999
, with
S(5000000001)+S(4999999999)=91
. It can be shown that it is impossible to get a larger answer.
