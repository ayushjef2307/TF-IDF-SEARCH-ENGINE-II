There are no heroes in this problem. I guess we should have named it "To Zero".
You are given two arrays
a
and
b
, each of these arrays contains
n
non-negative integers.
Let
c
be a matrix of size
n×n
such that
c
i,j
=|
a
i
−
b
j
|
for every
i∈[1,n]
and every
j∈[1,n]
.
Your goal is to transform the matrix
c
so that it becomes the zero matrix, i. e. a matrix where every element is exactly
0
. In order to do so, you may perform the following operations any number of times, in any order:
choose an integer
i
, then decrease
c
i,j
by
1
for every
j∈[1,n]
(i. e. decrease all elements in the
i
-th row by
1
). In order to perform this operation, you pay
1
coin;
choose an integer
j
, then decrease
c
i,j
by
1
for every
i∈[1,n]
(i. e. decrease all elements in the
j
-th column by
1
). In order to perform this operation, you pay
1
coin;
choose two integers
i
and
j
, then decrease
c
i,j
by
1
. In order to perform this operation, you pay
1
coin;
choose an integer
i
, then increase
c
i,j
by
1
for every
j∈[1,n]
(i. e. increase all elements in the
i
-th row by
1
). When you perform this operation, you receive
1
coin;
choose an integer
j
, then increase
c
i,j
by
1
for every
i∈[1,n]
(i. e. increase all elements in the
j
-th column by
1
). When you perform this operation, you receive
1
coin.
You have to calculate the minimum number of coins required to transform the matrix
c
into the zero matrix. Note that all elements of
c
should be equal to
0
simultaneously after the operations.
Input

a

a

,…,
a

(

c
into the zero matrix.

Note
In the first example, the matrix looks as follows:
1 1 1
0 0 0
1 1 1
You can turn it into a zero matrix using
2
coins as follows:
subtract
1
from the first row, paying
1
coin;
subtract
1
from the third row, paying
1
coin.
In the second example, the matrix looks as follows:
2 2 1
0 0 1
2 2 1
You can turn it into a zero matrix using
5
coins as follows:
subtract
1
from the first row, paying
1
coin;
subtract
1
from the third row, paying
1
coin;
subtract
1
from the third row, paying
