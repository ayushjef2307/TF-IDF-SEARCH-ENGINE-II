i
<i
).
There are
n
routers in Boogle in total now. Print the sequence of routers on the path from the first to the
n
-th router.

The first line contains integer number
n
(

) — the number of the routers. The following line contains
n−1
integers
p
2
,
p
3
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
<i
), where
p
i
is equal to index of the router to which the
i
-th was connected after purchase.
