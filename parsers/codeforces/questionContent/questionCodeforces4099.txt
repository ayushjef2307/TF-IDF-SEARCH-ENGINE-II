One of Arkady's friends works at a huge radio telescope. A few decades ago the telescope has sent a signal
s
towards a faraway galaxy. Recently they've received a response
t
which they believe to be a response from aliens! The scientists now want to check if the signal
t
is similar to
s
.
The original signal
s
was a sequence of zeros and ones (everyone knows that binary code is the universe-wide language). The returned signal
t
, however, does not look as easy as
s
, but the scientists don't give up! They represented
t
as a sequence of English letters and say that
t
is similar to
s
if you can replace all zeros in
s
with some string
r
0
and all ones in
s
with some other string
r
1
and obtain
t
. The strings
r
0
and
r
1
must be different and non-empty.
Please help Arkady's friend and find the number of possible replacements for zeros and ones (the number of pairs of strings
r
0
and
r
1
) that transform
s
to
t
.
Input
The first line contains a string
s
(
2≤|s|≤
10
5
) consisting of zeros and ones — the original signal.
The second line contains a string
t
(
1≤|t|≤
10
6
) consisting of lowercase English letters only — the received signal.
It is guaranteed, that the string
s
contains at least one '0' and at least one '1'.
Output
Print a single integer — the number of pairs of strings
r
0
and
r
1
that transform
s
to
t
.
In case there are no such pairs, print
0
.

Note
In the first example, the possible pairs
(
r
0
,
r
1
)
are as follows:
"a", "aaaaa"
"aa", "aaaa"
"aaaa", "aa"
"aaaaa", "a"
The pair "aaa", "aaa" is not allowed, since
r
0
and
r
1
must be different.
In the second example, the following pairs are possible:
"ko", "kokotlin"
"koko", "tlin"
