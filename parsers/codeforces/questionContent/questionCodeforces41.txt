You have an array
a
of
n
non-negative integers. Let's define
f(a,x)=[
a
1
modx,
a
2
modx,…,
a
n
modx]
for some positive integer
x
. Find the biggest
x
, such that
f(a,x)
is a palindrome.
Here,
amodx
is the remainder of the integer division of
a
by
x
.
An array is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. More formally, an array
a
of length
n
is a palindrome if for every
i
(
1≤i≤n
)
a
i
=
a
n−i+1
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
i
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
It's guaranteed that the sum of all
n
does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case output the biggest
x
, such that
f(a,x)
is a palindrome. If
x
can be infinitely large, output
0
instead.

Note
In the first example,
f(a,x=1)=[0,0]
which is a palindrome.
In the second example,
f(a,x=2)=[1,0,1,0,0,1,0,1]
which is a palindrome.
It can be proven that in the first two examples, no larger
x
satisfies the condition.
In the third example,
f(a,x)=[0]
for any
x
, so we can choose it infinitely large, so the answer is
0
.
