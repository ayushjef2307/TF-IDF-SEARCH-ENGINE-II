There is one apple tree in Arkady's garden. It can be represented as a set of junctions connected with branches so that there is only one way to reach any junctions from any other one using branches. The junctions are enumerated from
1
to
n
, the junction
1
is called the root.
A subtree of a junction
v
is a set of junctions
u
such that the path from
u
to the root must pass through
v
. Note that
v
itself is included in a subtree of
v
.
A leaf is such a junction that its subtree contains exactly one junction.
The New Year is coming, so Arkady wants to decorate the tree. He will put a light bulb of some color on each leaf junction and then count the number happy junctions. A happy junction is such a junction
t
that all light bulbs in the subtree of
t
have different colors.
Arkady is interested in the following question: for each
k
from
1
to
n
, what is the minimum number of different colors needed to make the number of happy junctions be greater than or equal to
k
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of junctions in the tree.
The second line contains
n−1
integers
p
2
,
p
3
, ...,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
<i
), where
p
i
means there is a branch between junctions
i
and
p
i
. It is guaranteed that this set of branches forms a tree.
Output
Output
n
integers. The
i
-th of them should be the minimum number of colors needed to make the number of happy junctions be at least
i
.

Note
In the first example for
k=1
and
k=2
we can use only one color: the junctions
2
and
3
will be happy. For
k=3
you have to put the bulbs of different colors to make all the junctions happy.
In the second example for
k=4
you can, for example, put the bulbs of color
1
in junctions
2
and
4
, and a bulb of color
2
into junction
5
. The happy junctions are the ones with indices
2
,
3
,
4
and
5
then.
