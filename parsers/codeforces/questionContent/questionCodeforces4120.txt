Suppose you are given a sequence
S
of
k
pairs of integers
(
a
1
,
b
1
),(
a
2
,
b
2
),…,(
a
k
,
b
k
)
.
You can perform the following operations on it:
Choose some position
i
and increase
a
i
by
1
. That can be performed only if there exists at least one such position
j
that
i≠j
and
a
i
=
a
j
. The cost of this operation is
b
i
;
Choose some position
i
and decrease
a
i
by
1
. That can be performed only if there exists at least one such position
j
that
a
i
=
a
j
+1
. The cost of this operation is
−
b
i
.
Each operation can be performed arbitrary number of times (possibly zero).
Let
f(S)
be minimum possible
x
such that there exists a sequence of operations with total cost
x
, after which all
a
i
from
S
are pairwise distinct.
Now for the task itself ...
You are given a sequence
P
consisting of
n
pairs of integers
(
a
1
,
b
1
),(
a
2
,
b
2
),…,(
a
n
,
b
n
)
. All
b
i
are pairwise distinct. Let
P
i
be the sequence consisting of the first
i
pairs of
P
. Your task is to calculate the values of
f(
P
1
),f(
P
2
),…,f(
P
n
)
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of pairs in sequence
P
.
Next
n
lines contain the elements of
P
:
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains two integers
a
i
and
b
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤
b
i
≤n
). It is guaranteed that all values of
b
i
are pairwise distinct.
Output
Print
n
integers — the
i
-th number should be equal to
f(
P
i
)
.
