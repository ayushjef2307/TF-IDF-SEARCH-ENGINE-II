You are given a weighed undirected connected graph, consisting of
n
vertices and
m
edges.
You should answer
q
queries, the
i
-th query is to find the shortest distance between vertices
u
i
and
v
i
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m (1≤n,m≤
10
5
,m−n≤20)
— the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
Next
m
lines contain the edges: the
i
-th edge is a triple of integers
v
i
,
u
i
,
d
i
 (1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n,1≤
d
i
≤
10
9
,
u
i
≠
v
i
)
. This triple means that there is an edge between vertices
u
i
and
v
i
of weight
d
i
. It is guaranteed that graph contains no self-loops and multiple edges.
The next line contains a single integer
q (1≤q≤
10
5
)
— the number of queries.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
u
i
and
v
i
 (1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n)
— descriptions of the queries.
Pay attention to the restriction
m−n ≤ 20
.
Output
Print
q
lines.
The
i
-th line should contain the answer to the
i
-th query — the shortest distance between vertices
u
i
and
v
i
.
