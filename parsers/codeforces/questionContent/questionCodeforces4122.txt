Vasya owns three big integers —
a,l,r
. Let's define a partition of
x
such a sequence of strings
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
k
that
s
1
+
s
2
+⋯+
s
k
=x
, where
+
is a concatanation of strings.
s
i
is the
i
-th element of the partition. For example, number
12345
has the following partitions: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], ["123", "4", "5"], ["1", "2345"], ["12345"] and lots of others.
Let's call some partition of
a
beautiful if each of its elements contains no leading zeros.
Vasya want to know the number of beautiful partitions of number
a
, which has each of
s
i
satisfy the condition
l≤
s
i
≤r
. Note that the comparison is the integer comparison, not the string one.
Help Vasya to count the amount of partitions of number
a
such that they match all the given requirements. The result can be rather big, so print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
a (1≤a≤
10
1000000
)
.
The second line contains a single integer
l (0≤l≤
10
1000000
)
.
The third line contains a single integer
r (0≤r≤
10
1000000
)
.
It is guaranteed that
l≤r
.
It is also guaranteed that numbers
a,l,r
contain no leading zeros.
Output
Print a single integer — the amount of partitions of number
a
such that they match all the given requirements modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case, there are two good partitions
13+5
and
1+3+5
.
In the second test case, there is one good partition
1+0+0+0+0
.
