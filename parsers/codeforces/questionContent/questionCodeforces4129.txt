Two friends are travelling through Bubble galaxy. They say "Hello!" via signals to each other if their distance is smaller or equal than
d
1
and
it's the first time they speak to each other or
at some point in time after their last talk their distance was greater than
d
2
.
We need to calculate how many times friends said "Hello!" to each other. For
N
moments, you'll have an array of points for each friend representing their positions at that moment. A person can stay in the same position between two moments in time, but if a person made a move we assume this movement as movement with constant speed in constant direction.
Input
The first line contains one integer number
N
(
2≤N≤100000
) representing number of moments in which we captured positions for two friends.
The second line contains two integer numbers
d
1
and
d
2
 (0<
d
1
<
d
2
<1000)
.
The next
N
lines contains four integer numbers
A
x
,
A
y
,
B
x
,
B
y
(
0≤
A
x
,
A
y
,
B
x
,
B
y
≤1000
) representing coordinates of friends A and B in each captured moment.
Output
Output contains one integer number that represents how many times friends will say "Hello!" to each other.

Note
Explanation: Friends should send signals 2 times to each other, first time around point
A2
and
B2
and second time during A's travel from point
A3
to
A4
while B stays in point
B3=B4
