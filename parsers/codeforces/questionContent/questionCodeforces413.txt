Monocarp is planning on opening a chemistry lab. During the first month, he's going to distribute solutions of a certain acid.
First, he will sign some contracts with a local chemistry factory. Each contract provides Monocarp with an unlimited supply of some solution of the same acid. The factory provides
n
contract options, numbered from
1
to
n
. The
i
-th solution has a concentration of
x
i
%
, the contract costs
w
i
burles, and Monocarp will be able to sell it for
c
i
burles per liter.
Monocarp is expecting
k
customers during the first month. Each customer will buy a liter of a
y%
-solution, where
y
is a real number chosen uniformly at random from
0
to
100
independently for each customer. More formally, the probability of number
y
being less than or equal to some
t
is
P(y≤t)=
t
100
.
Monocarp can mix the solution that he signed the contracts with the factory for, at any ratio. More formally, if he has contracts for
m
solutions with concentrations
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
m
, then, for these solutions, he picks their volumes
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
m
so that
∑
i=1
m
a
i
=1
(exactly
1
since each customer wants exactly one liter of a certain solution).
The concentration of the resulting solution is
∑
i=1
m
x
i
⋅
a
i
. The price of the resulting solution is
∑
i=1
m
c
i
⋅
a
i
.
If Monocarp can obtain a solution of concentration
y%
, then he will do it while maximizing its price (the cost for the customer). Otherwise, the customer leaves without buying anything, and the price is considered equal to
0
.
Monocarp wants to sign some contracts with a factory (possibly, none or all of them) so that the expected profit is maximized — the expected total price of the sold solutions for all
k
customers minus the total cost of signing the contracts from the factory.
Print the maximum expected profit Monocarp can achieve.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤5000
;
1≤k≤
10
5
) — the number of contracts the factory provides and the number of customers.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains three integers
x
i
,
w
i
and
c
i
(
0≤
x
i
≤100
;
1≤
w
i
≤
10
9
;
1≤
c
i
≤
10
5
) — the concentration of the solution, the cost of the contract and the cost per liter for the customer, for the
i
-th contract.
Output
Print a single real number — the maximum expected profit Monocarp can achieve.
Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
−6
.
Formally, let your answer be
a
, and the jury's answer be
b
. Your answer is accepted if and only if
|a−b|
max(1,|b|)
≤
10
−6
.
