Formula 1 officials decided to introduce new competition. Cars are replaced by space ships and number of points awarded can differ per race.
Given the current ranking in the competition and points distribution for the next race, your task is to calculate the best possible ranking for a given astronaut after the next race. It's guaranteed that given astronaut will have unique number of points before the race.
Input
The first line contains two integer numbers
N
(
1≤N≤200000
) representing number of F1 astronauts, and current position of astronaut
D
(
1≤D≤N
) you want to calculate best ranking for (no other competitor will have the same number of points before the race).
The second line contains

k

k=1...N
), separated by a single space, representing current ranking of astronauts. Points are sorted in non-increasing order.

Output
Output contains one integer number — the best possible ranking for astronaut after the race. If multiple astronauts have the same score after the race, they all share the best ranking.

Note
If the third ranked astronaut wins the race, he will have 35 points. He cannot take the leading position, but he can overtake the second position if the second ranked astronaut finishes the race at the last position.
