Awruk is taking part in elections in his school. It is the final round. He has only one opponent — Elodreip. The are
n
students in the school. Each student has exactly
k
votes and is obligated to use all of them. So Awruk knows that if a person gives
a
i
votes for Elodreip, than he will get exactly
k−
a
i
votes from this person. Of course
0≤k−
a
i
holds.
Awruk knows that if he loses his life is over. He has been speaking a lot with his friends and now he knows
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
— how many votes for Elodreip each student wants to give. Now he wants to change the number
k
to win the elections. Of course he knows that bigger
k
means bigger chance that somebody may notice that he has changed something and then he will be disqualified.
So, Awruk knows
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
— how many votes each student will give to his opponent. Help him select the smallest winning number
k
. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.
Input
The first line contains integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the number of students in the school.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤100
) — the number of votes each student gives to Elodreip.
Output
Output the smallest integer
k
(
k≥max
a
i
) which gives Awruk the victory. In order to win, Awruk needs to get strictly more votes than Elodreip.

Note
In the first example, Elodreip gets
1+1+1+5+1=9
votes. The smallest possible
k
is
5
(it surely can't be less due to the fourth person), and it leads to
4+4+4+0+4=16
votes for Awruk, which is enough to win.
In the second example, Elodreip gets
11
votes. If
k=4
, Awruk gets
9
votes and loses to Elodreip.
