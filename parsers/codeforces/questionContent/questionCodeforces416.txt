Consider a deck of cards. Each card has one of
4
suits, and there are exactly
n
cards for each suit — so, the total number of cards in the deck is
4n
. The deck is shuffled randomly so that each of
(4n)!
possible orders of cards in the deck has the same probability of being the result of shuffling. Let
c
i
be the
i
-th card of the deck (from top to bottom).
Monocarp starts drawing the cards from the deck one by one. Before drawing a card, he tries to guess its suit. Monocarp remembers the suits of the
k
last cards, and his guess is the suit that appeared the least often among the last
k
cards he has drawn. So, while drawing the
i
-th card, Monocarp guesses that its suit is the suit that appears the minimum number of times among the cards
c
i−k
,
c
i−k+1
,…,
c
i−1
(if
i≤k
, Monocarp considers all previously drawn cards, that is, the cards
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
i−1
). If there are multiple suits that appeared the minimum number of times among the previous cards Monocarp remembers, he chooses a random suit out of those for his guess (all suits that appeared the minimum number of times have the same probability of being chosen).
After making a guess, Monocarp draws a card and compares its suit to his guess. If they match, then his guess was correct; otherwise it was incorrect.
Your task is to calculate the expected number of correct guesses Monocarp makes after drawing all
4n
cards from the deck.
Input
The first (and only) line contains two integers
n
(
1≤n≤500
) and
k
(
1≤k≤4⋅n
).
Output
Let the expected value you have to calculate be an irreducible fraction
x
y
. Print one integer — the value of
x⋅
y
−1
mod998244353
, where
y
−1
is the inverse to
y
(i. e. an integer such that
y⋅
y
−1
mod998244353=1
).
