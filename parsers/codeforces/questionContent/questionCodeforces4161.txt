You are given a tube which is reflective inside represented as two non-coinciding, but parallel to
Ox
lines. Each line has some special integer points — positions of sensors on sides of the tube.
You are going to emit a laser ray in the tube. To do so, you have to choose two integer points
A
and
B
on the first and the second line respectively (coordinates can be negative): the point
A
is responsible for the position of the laser, and the point
B
 — for the direction of the laser ray. The laser ray is a ray starting at
A
and directed at
B
which will reflect from the sides of the tube (it doesn't matter if there are any sensors at a reflection point or not). A sensor will only register the ray if the ray hits exactly at the position of the sensor.
Examples of laser rays. Note that image contains two examples. The
3
sensors (denoted by black bold points on the tube sides) will register the blue ray but only
2
will register the red.
Calculate the maximum number of sensors which can register your ray if you choose points
A
and
B
on the first and the second lines respectively.

(
