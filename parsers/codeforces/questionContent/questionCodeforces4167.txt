Long story short, shashlik is Miroslav's favorite food. Shashlik is prepared on several skewers simultaneously. There are two states for each skewer: initial and turned over.
This time Miroslav laid out
n
skewers parallel to each other, and enumerated them with consecutive integers from
1
to
n
in order from left to right. For better cooking, he puts them quite close to each other, so when he turns skewer number
i
, it leads to turning
k
closest skewers from each side of the skewer
i
, that is, skewers number
i−k
,
i−k+1
, ...,
i−1
,
i+1
, ...,
i+k−1
,
i+k
(if they exist).
For example, let
n=6
and
k=1
. When Miroslav turns skewer number
3
, then skewers with numbers
2
,
3
, and
4
will come up turned over. If after that he turns skewer number
1
, then skewers number
1
,
3
, and
4
will be turned over, while skewer number
2
will be in the initial position (because it is turned again).
As we said before, the art of cooking requires perfect timing, so Miroslav wants to turn over all
n
skewers with the minimal possible number of actions. For example, for the above example
n=6
and
k=1
, two turnings are sufficient: he can turn over skewers number
2
and
5
.
Help Miroslav turn over all
n
skewers.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤1000
,
0≤k≤1000
) — the number of skewers and the number of skewers from each side that are turned in one step.
Output
The first line should contain integer
l
 — the minimum number of actions needed by Miroslav to turn over all
n
skewers. After than print
l
integers from
1
to
n
denoting the number of the skewer that is to be turned over at the corresponding step.

Note
In the first example the first operation turns over skewers
1
,
2
and
3
, the second operation turns over skewers
4
,
5
,
6
and
7
.
In the second example it is also correct to turn over skewers
2
and
5
, but turning skewers
2
and
4
, or
1
and
5
are incorrect solutions because the skewer
3
is in the initial state after these operations.
