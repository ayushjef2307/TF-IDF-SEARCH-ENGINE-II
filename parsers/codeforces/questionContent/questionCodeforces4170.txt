A tree is an undirected graph with exactly one simple path between each pair of vertices. We call a set of simple paths
k
-valid if each vertex of the tree belongs to no more than one of these paths (including endpoints) and each path consists of exactly
k
vertices.
You are given a tree with
n
vertices. For each
k
from
1
to
n
inclusive find what is the maximum possible size of a
k
-valid set of simple paths.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤100000
) — the number of vertices in the tree.
Then following
n−1
lines describe the tree, each of them contains two integers
v
,
u
(
1≤v,u≤n
) — endpoints of the corresponding edge.
It is guaranteed, that the given graph is a tree.
Output
Output
n
numbers, the
i
-th of which is the maximum possible number of paths in an
i
-valid set of paths.
