There are
n
persons who initially don't know each other. On each morning, two of them, who were not friends before, become friends.
We want to plan a trip for every evening of
m
days. On each trip, you have to select a group of people that will go on the trip. For every person, one of the following should hold:
Either this person does not go on the trip,
Or at least
k
of his friends also go on the trip.
Note that the friendship is not transitive. That is, if
a
and
b
are friends and
b
and
c
are friends, it does not necessarily imply that
a
and
c
are friends.
For each day, find the maximum number of people that can go on the trip on that day.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
, and
k
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,1≤m≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤k<n
) — the number of people, the number of days and the number of friends each person on the trip should have in the group.
The
i
-th (
1≤i≤m
) of the next
m
lines contains two integers
x
and
y
(
1≤x,y≤n
,
x≠y
), meaning that persons
x
and
y
become friends on the morning of day
i
. It is guaranteed that
x
and
y
were not friends before.
Output
Print exactly
m
lines, where the
i
-th of them (
1≤i≤m
) contains the maximum number of people that can go on the trip on the evening of the day
i
.
