Let's call
x
elegant if the greatest common divisor of the sequence
k

Count the number of elegant integers from
2
to
n
.
Each testcase contains several values of
n
, for each of them you are required to solve the problem separately.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
T
(
1≤T≤
10
5
) — the number of values of
n
in the testcase.
Each of the next
T
lines contains a single integer
n
i
(
2≤
n
i
≤

).
Output
Print
T
lines — the
i
-th line should contain the number of elegant numbers from
2
to
n
i
.
