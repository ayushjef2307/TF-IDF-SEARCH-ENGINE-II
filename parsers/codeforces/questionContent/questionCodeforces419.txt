Doremy has
n
buckets of paint which is represented by an array
a
of length
n
. Bucket
i
contains paint with color
a
i
. Initially,
a
i
=i
.
Doremy has
m
segments
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
). Each segment describes an operation. Operation
i
is performed as follows:
For each
j
such that
l
i
<j≤
r
i
, set
a
j
:=
a
l
i
.
Doremy also selects an integer
k
. She wants to know for each integer
x
from
0
to
m−1
, the number of distinct colors in the array after performing operations
xmodm+1,(x+1)modm+1,…,(x+k−1)modm+1
. Can you help her calculate these values? Note that for each
x
individually we start from the initial array and perform only the given
k
operations in the given order.
Input
The first line of input contains three integers
n
,
m
, and
k
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤k≤m
) — the length of the array
a
, the total number of operations, and the integer that Doremy selects.
The
i
-th line of the following
m
lines contains two integers
l
i
,
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
) — the bounds of the
i
-th segment.
Output
Output
m
integers. The
(x+1)
-th integer should be the number of distinct colors in the array if we start from the initial array and perform operations
xmodm+1,(x+1)modm+1,…,(x+k−1)modm+1
.
