After a long day, Alice and Bob decided to play a little game. The game board consists of
n
cells in a straight line, numbered from
1
to
n
, where each cell contains a number
a
i
between
1
and
n
. Furthermore, no two cells contain the same number.
A token is placed in one of the cells. They take alternating turns of moving the token around the board, with Alice moving first. The current player can move from cell
i
to cell
j
only if the following two conditions are satisfied:
the number in the new cell
j
must be strictly larger than the number in the old cell
i
(i.e.
a
j
>
a
i
), and
the distance that the token travels during this turn must be a multiple of the number in the old cell (i.e.
|i−j|mod
a
i
=0
).
Whoever is unable to make a move, loses. For each possible starting position, determine who wins if they both play optimally. It can be shown that the game is always finite, i.e. there always is a winning strategy for one of the players.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of numbers.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
). Furthermore, there are no pair of indices
i≠j
such that
a
i
=
a
j
.
Output
Print
s
 — a string of
n
characters, where the
i
-th character represents the outcome of the game if the token is initially placed in the cell
i
. If Alice wins, then
s
i
has to be equal to "A"; otherwise,
s
i
has to be equal to "B".

Note
In the first sample, if Bob puts the token on the number (not position):
1
: Alice can move to any number. She can win by picking
7
, from which Bob has no move.
2
: Alice can move to
3
and
5
. Upon moving to
5
, Bob can win by moving to
8
. If she chooses
3
instead, she wins, as Bob has only a move to
4
, from which Alice can move to
8
.
3
: Alice can only move to
4
, after which Bob wins by moving to
8
.
4
,
5
, or
6
: Alice wins by moving to
8
.
7
,
8
: Alice has no move, and hence she loses immediately.
