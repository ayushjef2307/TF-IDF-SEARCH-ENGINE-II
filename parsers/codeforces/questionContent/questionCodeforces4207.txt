There are
n
parrots standing in a circle. Each parrot has a certain level of respect among other parrots, namely
r
i
. When a parrot with respect level
x
starts chattering,
x
neighbours to the right and to the left of it start repeating the same words in 1 second. Their neighbours then start repeating as well, and so on, until all the birds begin to chatter.
You are given the respect levels of all parrots. For each parrot answer a question: if this certain parrot starts chattering, how many seconds will pass until all other birds will start repeating it?
Input
In the first line of input there is a single integer
n
, the number of parrots (
1≤n≤
10
5
).
In the next line of input there are
n
integers
r
1
, ...,
r
n
, the respect levels of parrots in order they stand in the circle (
1≤
r
i
≤n
).
Output
Print
n
integers.
i
-th of them should equal the number of seconds that is needed for all parrots to start chattering if the
i
-th parrot is the first to start.
