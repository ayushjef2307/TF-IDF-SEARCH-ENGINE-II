You have a set of
n
weights. You know that their masses are
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
n
grams, but you don't know which of them has which mass. You can't distinguish the weights.
However, your friend does know the mass of each weight. You can ask your friend to give you exactly
k
weights with the total mass
m
(both parameters
k
and
m
are chosen by you), and your friend will point to any valid subset of weights, if it is possible.
You are allowed to make this query only once. Find the maximum possible number of weights you can reveal after this query.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the number of weights.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤100
) — the masses of the weights.
Output
Print the maximum number of weights you can learn the masses for after making a single query.

Note
In the first example we can ask for a subset of two weights with total mass being equal to
4
, and the only option is to get
{2,2}
.
Another way to obtain the same result is to ask for a subset of two weights with the total mass of
5
and get
{1,4}
. It is easy to see that the two remaining weights have mass of
2
grams each.
In the second example we can ask for a subset of two weights with total mass being
8
, and the only answer is
{4,4}
. We can prove it is not possible to learn masses for three weights in one query, but we won't put the proof here.
