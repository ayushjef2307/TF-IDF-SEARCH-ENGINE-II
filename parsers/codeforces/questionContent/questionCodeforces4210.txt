In this problem we consider a very simplified model of Barcelona city.
Barcelona can be represented as a plane with streets of kind
x=c
and
y=c
for every integer
c
(that is, the rectangular grid). However, there is a detail which makes Barcelona different from Manhattan. There is an avenue called Avinguda Diagonal which can be represented as a the set of points
(x,y)
for which
ax+by+c=0
.
One can walk along streets, including the avenue. You are given two integer points
A
and
B
somewhere in Barcelona. Find the minimal possible distance one needs to travel to get to
B
from
A
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
a
,
b
and
c
(
−
10
9
≤a,b,c≤
10
9
, at least one of
a
and
b
is not zero) representing the Diagonal Avenue.
The next line contains four integers
x
1
,
y
1
,
x
2
and
y
2
(
−

9
≤
x
1
,
y

,
x
2
,
y
2
≤

9
) denoting the points
A=(
x
1
,
y
1
)
and
B=(
x
2
,
y
2
)
.
Output
Find the minimum possible travel distance between
A
and
B
. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed
10
−6
.
Formally, let your answer be
a
, and the jury's answer be
b
. Your answer is accepted if and only if
|a−b|
max(1,|b|)
≤
10
−6
.
