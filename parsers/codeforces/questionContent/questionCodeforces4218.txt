When Masha came to math classes today, she saw two integer sequences of length
n−1
on the blackboard. Let's denote the elements of the first sequence as
a
i
(
0≤
a
i
≤3
), and the elements of the second sequence as
b
i
(
0≤
b
i
≤3
).
Masha became interested if or not there is an integer sequence of length
n
, which elements we will denote as
t
i
(
0≤
t
i
≤3
), so that for every
i
(
1≤i≤n−1
) the following is true:
a
i
=
t
i
|
t
i+1
(where
|
denotes the bitwise OR operation) and
b
i
=
t
i
&
t
i+1
(where
&
denotes the bitwise AND operation).
The question appeared to be too difficult for Masha, so now she asked you to check whether such a sequence
t
i
of length
n
exists. If it exists, find such a sequence. If there are multiple such sequences, find any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the sequence
t
i
.
The second line contains
n−1
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n−1
(
0≤
a
i
≤3
) — the first sequence on the blackboard.
The third line contains
n−1
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n−1
(
0≤
b
i
≤3
) — the second sequence on the blackboard.
Output
In the first line print "YES" (without quotes), if there is a sequence
t
i
that satisfies the conditions from the statements, and "NO" (without quotes), if there is no such sequence.
If there is such a sequence, on the second line print
n
integers
t
1
,
t
2
,…,
t
n
(
0≤
t
i
≤3
) — the sequence that satisfies the statements conditions.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

t

.
In the second example there is no such sequence.
