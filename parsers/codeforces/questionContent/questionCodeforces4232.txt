You are given a string
t
consisting of
n
lowercase Latin letters and an integer number
k
.
Let's define a substring of some string
s
with indices from
l
to
r
as
s[l…r]
.
Your task is to construct such string
s
of minimum possible length that there are exactly
k
positions
i
such that
s[i…i+n−1]=t
. In other words, your task is to construct such string
s
of minimum possible length that there are exactly
k
substrings of
s
equal to
t
.
It is guaranteed that the answer is always unique.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n,k≤50
) — the length of the string
t
and the number of substrings.
The second line of the input contains the string
t
consisting of exactly
n
lowercase Latin letters.
Output
Print such string
s
of minimum possible length that there are exactly
k
substrings of
s
equal to
t
.
It is guaranteed that the answer is always unique.
