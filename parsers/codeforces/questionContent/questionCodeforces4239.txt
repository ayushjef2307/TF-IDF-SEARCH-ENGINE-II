Let
s(x)
be sum of digits in decimal representation of positive integer
x
. Given two integers
n
and
m
, find some positive integers
a
and
b
such that
s(a)≥n
,
s(b)≥n
,
s(a+b)≤m
.
Input
The only line of input contain two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤1129
).
Output
Print two lines, one for decimal representation of
a
and one for decimal representation of
b
. Both numbers must not contain leading zeros and must have length no more than
2230
.

Note
In the first sample, we have
n=6
and
m=5
. One valid solution is
a=6
,
b=7
. Indeed, we have
s(a)=6≥n
and
s(b)=7≥n
, and also
s(a+b)=s(13)=4≤m
.
