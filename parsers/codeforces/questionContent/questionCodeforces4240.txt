Consider a table of size
n×m
, initially fully white. Rows are numbered
1
through
n
from top to bottom, columns
1
through
m
from left to right. Some square inside the table with odd side length was painted black. Find the center of this square.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤115
) — the number of rows and the number of columns in the table.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains a string of
m
characters
s
i1
s
i2
…
s
im
(
s
ij
is 'W' for white cells and 'B' for black cells), describing the
i
-th row of the table.
Output
Output two integers
r
and
c
(
1≤r≤n
,
1≤c≤m
) separated by a space — the row and column numbers of the center of the black square.
