The campus has
m
rooms numbered from
0
to
m−1
. Also the
x
-mouse lives in the campus. The
x
-mouse is not just a mouse: each second
x
-mouse moves from room
i
to the room
i⋅xmodm
(in fact, it teleports from one room to another since it doesn't visit any intermediate room). Starting position of the
x
-mouse is unknown.
You are responsible to catch the
x
-mouse in the campus, so you are guessing about minimum possible number of traps (one trap in one room) you need to place. You are sure that if the
x
-mouse enters a trapped room, it immediately gets caught.
And the only observation you made is
GCD(x,m)=1
.
Input
The only line contains two integers
m
and
x
(
2≤m≤
10
14
,
1≤x<m
,
GCD(x,m)=1
) — the number of rooms and the parameter of
x
-mouse.
Output
Print the only integer — minimum number of traps you need to install to catch the
x
-mouse.

Note
In the first example you can, for example, put traps in rooms
0
,
2
,
3
. If the
x
-mouse starts in one of this rooms it will be caught immediately. If
x
-mouse starts in the
1
-st rooms then it will move to the room
3
, where it will be caught.
In the second example you can put one trap in room
0
and one trap in any other room since
x
-mouse will visit all rooms
1..m−1
if it will start in any of these rooms.
