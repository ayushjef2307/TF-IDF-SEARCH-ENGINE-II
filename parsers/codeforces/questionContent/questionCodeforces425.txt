Doremy has
n+1
pegs. There are
n
red pegs arranged as vertices of a regular
n
-sided polygon, numbered from
1
to
n
in anti-clockwise order. There is also a blue peg of slightly smaller diameter in the middle of the polygon. A rubber band is stretched around the red pegs.
Doremy is very bored today and has decided to play a game. Initially, she has an empty array
a
. While the rubber band does not touch the blue peg, she will:
choose
i
(
1≤i≤n
) such that the red peg
i
has not been removed;
remove the red peg
i
;
append
i
to the back of
a
.
Doremy wonders how many possible different arrays
a
can be produced by the following process. Since the answer can be big, you are only required to output it modulo
p
.
p
is guaranteed to be a prime number.
game with
n=9
and
a=[7,5,2,8,3,9,4]
and another game with
n=8
and
a=[3,4,7,1,8,5,2]
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
p
(
3≤n≤5000
,
10
8
≤p≤
10
9
) — the number of red pegs and the modulo respectively.
p
is guaranteed to be a prime number.
Output
Output a single integer, the number of different arrays
a
that can be produced by the process described above modulo
p
.

Note
In the first test case,
n=4
, some possible arrays
a
that can be produced are
[4,2,3]
and
[1,4]
. However, it is not possible for
a
to be
[1]
or
[1,4,3]
.
