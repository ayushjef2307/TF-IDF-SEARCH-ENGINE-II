In "The Man in the High Castle" world, there are
m
different film endings.
Abendsen owns a storage and a shelf. At first, he has
n
ordered films on the shelf. In the
i
-th month he will do:
Empty the storage.
Put
k
i
⋅m
films into the storage,
k
i
films for each ending.
He will think about a question: if he puts all the films from the shelf into the storage, then randomly picks
n
films (from all the films in the storage) and rearranges them on the shelf, what is the probability that sequence of endings in
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
on the shelf will not be changed? Notice, he just thinks about this question, so the shelf will not actually be changed.
Answer all Abendsen's questions.
Let the probability be fraction
P
i
. Let's say that the total number of ways to take
n
films from the storage for
i
-th month is
A
i
, so
P
i
⋅
A
i
is always an integer. Print for each month

998244353
is a prime number and it is equal to

It is guaranteed that there will be only no more than
100
different
k
values.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
, and
q
(
1≤n,m,q≤
10
5
,
n+q≤
10
5
) — the number of films on the shelf initially, the number of endings, and the number of months.
The second line contains
n
integers
e
1
,
e
2
,…,
e
n
(
1≤
e
i
≤m
) — the ending of the
i
-th film on the shelf.
Each of the next
q
lines contains three integers
l
i
,
r
i
, and
k
i
(

) — the
i
-th query.
It is guaranteed that there will be only no more than
100
different
k
values.

Note
In the first sample in the second query, after adding
2⋅m
films into the storage, the storage will look like this:
{1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4}
.
There are
26730
total ways of choosing the films so that
e
l
,
e
l+1
,…,
e
r
will not be changed, for example,
[1,2,3,2,2]
and
[1,2,3,4,3]
are such ways.
There are
2162160
total ways of choosing the films, so you're asked to print
