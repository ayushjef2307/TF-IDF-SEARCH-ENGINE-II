Mrs. Smith is trying to contact her husband, John Smith, but she forgot the secret phone number!
The only thing Mrs. Smith remembered was that any permutation of
n
can be a secret phone number. Only those permutations that minimize secret value might be the phone of her husband.
The sequence of
n
integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from
1
to
n
exactly once.
The secret value of a phone number is defined as the sum of the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) and length of the longest decreasing subsequence (LDS).
A subsequence
a
i
1
,
a
i
2
,…,
a
i
k
where
1≤
i
1
<
i
2
<…<
i
k
≤n
is called increasing if
a
i
1
<
a
i
2
<
a
i
3
<…<
a
i
k
. If
a
i
1
>
a
i
2
>
a
i
3
>…>
a
i
k
, a subsequence is called decreasing. An increasing/decreasing subsequence is called longest if it has maximum length among all increasing/decreasing subsequences.
For example, if there is a permutation
[6,4,1,7,2,3,5]
, LIS of this permutation will be
[1,2,3,5]
, so the length of LIS is equal to
4
. LDS can be
[6,4,1]
,
[6,4,2]
, or
[6,4,3]
, so the length of LDS is
3
.
Note, the lengths of LIS and LDS can be different.
So please help Mrs. Smith to find a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS.
Input
The only line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of permutation that you need to build.
Output
Print a permutation that gives a minimum sum of lengths of LIS and LDS.
If there are multiple answers, print any.

Note
In the first sample, you can build a permutation
[3,4,1,2]
. LIS is
[3,4]
(or
[1,2]
), so the length of LIS is equal to
2
. LDS can be ony of
[3,1]
,
[4,2]
,
[3,2]
, or
[4,1]
. The length of LDS is also equal to
2
. The sum is equal to
4
. Note that
[3,4,1,2]
is not the only permutation that is valid.
In the second sample, you can build a permutation
[2,1]
. LIS is
[1]
(or
[2]
), so the length of LIS is equal to
1
. LDS is
[2,1]
, so the length of LDS is equal to
2
. The sum is equal to
3
. Note that permutation
[1,2]
is also valid.
