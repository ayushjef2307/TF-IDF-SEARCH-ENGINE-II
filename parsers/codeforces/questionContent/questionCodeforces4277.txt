Since next season are coming, you'd like to form a team from two or three participants. There are
n
candidates, the
i
-th candidate has rank
a
i
. But you have weird requirements for your teammates: if you have rank
v
and have chosen the
i
-th and
j
-th candidate, then
GCD(v,
a
i
)=X
and
LCM(v,
a
j
)=Y
must be met.
You are very experienced, so you can change your rank to any non-negative integer but
X
and
Y
are tied with your birthdate, so they are fixed.
Now you want to know, how many are there pairs
(i,j)
such that there exists an integer
v
meeting the following constraints:
GCD(v,
a
i
)=X
and
LCM(v,
a
j
)=Y
. It's possible that
i=j
and you form a team of two.
GCD
is the greatest common divisor of two number,
LCM
— the least common multiple.
Input
First line contains three integers
n
,
X
and
Y
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤X≤Y≤
10
18
) — the number of candidates and corresponding constants.
Second line contains
n
space separated integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
18
) — ranks of candidates.
Output
Print the only integer — the number of pairs
(i,j)
such that there exists an integer
v
meeting the following constraints:
GCD(v,
a
i
)=X
and
LCM(v,
a
j
)=Y
. It's possible that
i=j
.

Note
In the first example next pairs are valid:
a
j
=1
and
a
i
=[2,4,6,8,10,12]
or
a
j
=2
and
a
i
=[2,4,6,8,10,12]
. The
v
in both cases can be equal to
2
.
In the second example next pairs are valid:
a
j
=1
and
a
i
=[1,5,7,11]
;
a
j
=2
and
a
i
=[1,5,7,11,10,8,4,2]
;
a
j
=3
and
a
i
=[1,3,5,7,9,11]
;
a
j
=6
and
a
i
=[1,3,5,7,9,11,12,10,8,6,4,2]
