Doremy has
n
buckets of paint which is represented by an array
a
of length
n
. Bucket
i
contains paint with color
a
i
.
Let
c(l,r)
be the number of distinct elements in the subarray
[
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
]
. Choose
2
integers
l
and
r
such that
l≤r
and
r−l−c(l,r)
is maximized.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output
l
and
r
such that
l≤r
and
r−l−c(l,r)
is maximized.
If there are multiple solutions, you may output any.

Note
In the first test case,
a=[1,3,2,2,4]
.
When
l=1
and
r=3
,
c(l,r)=3
(there are
3
distinct elements in
[1,3,2]
).
When
l=2
and
r=4
,
c(l,r)=2
(there are
2
distinct elements in
[3,2,2]
).
It can be shown that choosing
l=2
and
r=4
maximizes the value of
r−l−c(l,r)
at
0
.
For the second test case,
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
.
When
l=1
and
r=5
,
c(l,r)=5
(there are
5
distinct elements in
[1,2,3,4,5]
).
When
l=3
and
r=3
,
c(l,r)=1
(there is
1
distinct element in
[3]
).
It can be shown that choosing
l=1
and
r=5
maximizes the value of
r−l−c(l,r)
at
−1
. Choosing
l=3
and
r=3
is also acceptable.
