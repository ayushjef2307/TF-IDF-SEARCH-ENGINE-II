Let's call an ordered pair of nodes
(u,v)
in a directed graph unidirectional if
u≠v
, there exists a path from
u
to
v
, and there are no paths from
v
to
u
.
A directed graph is called
p
-reachable if it contains exactly
p
ordered pairs of nodes
(u,v)
such that
u<v
and
u
and
v
are reachable from each other. Find the minimum number of nodes required to create a
p
-reachable directed graph.
Also, among all such
p
-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes, let
G
denote a graph which maximizes the number of unidirectional pairs of nodes. Find this number.
Input
The first and only line contains a single integer
p
(
0≤p≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of ordered pairs of nodes.
Output
Print a single line containing two integers — the minimum number of nodes required to create a
p
-reachable directed graph, and the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes among all such
p
-reachable directed graphs with the minimum number of nodes.

Note
In the first test case, the minimum number of nodes required to create a
3
-reachable directed graph is
3
. Among all
3
-reachable directed graphs with
3
nodes, the following graph
G
is one of the graphs with the maximum number of unidirectional pairs of nodes, which is
0
.
