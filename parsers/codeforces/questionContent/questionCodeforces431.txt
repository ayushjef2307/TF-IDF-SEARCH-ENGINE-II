You are given five integers
n
,
i
,
j
,
x
, and
y
. Find the number of bitonic permutations
B
, of the numbers
1
to
n
, such that
B
i
=x
, and
B
j
=y
. Since the answer can be large, compute it modulo

A bitonic permutation is a permutation of numbers, such that the elements of the permutation first increase till a certain index
k
,
2≤k≤n−1
, and then decrease till the end. Refer to notes for further clarification.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains five integers,
n
,
i
,
j
,
x
, and
y
(
3≤n≤100
and
1≤i,j,x,y≤n
). It is guaranteed that
i<j
and
x≠y
.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number of bitonic permutations satisfying the above conditions modulo
10

+7
.

Note
A permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
An array of
n≥3
elements is bitonic if its elements are first increasing till an index
k
,
2≤k≤n−1
, and then decreasing till the end. For example,
[2,5,8,6,1]
is a bitonic array with
k=3
, but
[2,5,8,1,6]
is not a bitonic array (elements first increase till
k=3
, then decrease, and then increase again).
A bitonic permutation is a permutation in which the elements follow the above-mentioned bitonic property. For example,
[2,3,5,4,1]
is a bitonic permutation, but
[2,3,5,1,4]
is not a bitonic permutation (since it is not a bitonic array) and
[2,3,4,4,1]
is also not a bitonic permutation (since it is not a permutation).
Sample Test Case Description
For
n=3
, possible permutations are
[1,2,3]
,
[1,3,2]
,
[2,1,3]
,
[2,3,1]
,
[3,1,2]
, and
[3,2,1]
. Among the given permutations, the bitonic permutations are
[1,3,2]
and
[2,3,1]
.
In the first test case, the expected permutation must be of the form
[2,?,3]
, which does not satisfy either of the two bitonic permutations with
n=3
, therefore the answer is 0.
In the second test case, the expected permutation must be of the form
[?,3,2]
, which only satisfies the bitonic permutation
[1,3,2]
, therefore, the answer is 1.
