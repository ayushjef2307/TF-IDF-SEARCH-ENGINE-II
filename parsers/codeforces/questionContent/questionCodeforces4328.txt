You are given an integer sequence
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
.
Find the number of pairs of indices
(l,r)
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) such that the value of median of
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
is exactly the given number
m
.
The median of a sequence is the value of an element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.
For example, if
a=[4,2,7,5]
then its median is
4
since after sorting the sequence, it will look like
[2,4,5,7]
and the left of two middle elements is equal to
4
. The median of
[7,1,2,9,6]
equals
6
since after sorting, the value
6
will be in the middle of the sequence.
Write a program to find the number of pairs of indices
(l,r)
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) such that the value of median of
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
is exactly the given number
m
.
Input
The first line contains integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤2⋅
10

) — the length of the given sequence and the required value of the median.
The second line contains an integer sequence
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
