You are given a permutation
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
. A permutation of length
n
is a sequence such that each integer between
1
and
n
occurs exactly once in the sequence.
Find the number of pairs of indices
(l,r)
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) such that the value of the median of
p
l
,
p
l+1
,…,
p
r
is exactly the given number
m
.
The median of a sequence is the value of the element which is in the middle of the sequence after sorting it in non-decreasing order. If the length of the sequence is even, the left of two middle elements is used.
For example, if
a=[4,2,7,5]
then its median is
4
since after sorting the sequence, it will look like
[2,4,5,7]
and the left of two middle elements is equal to
4
. The median of
[7,1,2,9,6]
equals
6
since after sorting, the value
6
will be in the middle of the sequence.
Write a program to find the number of pairs of indices
(l,r)
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) such that the value of the median of
p
l
,
p
l+1
,…,
p
r
is exactly the given number
m
.
Input
The first line contains integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤m≤n
) — the length of the given sequence and the required value of the median.
The second line contains a permutation
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
). Each integer between
1
and
n
occurs in
p
exactly once.
