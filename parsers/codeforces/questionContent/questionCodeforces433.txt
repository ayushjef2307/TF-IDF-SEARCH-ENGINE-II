To destroy humanity, The Monster Association sent
n
monsters to Earth's surface. The
i
-th monster has health
h
i
and power
p
i
.
With his last resort attack, True Spiral Incineration Cannon, Genos can deal
k
damage to all monsters alive. In other words, Genos can reduce the health of all monsters by
k
(if
k>0
) with a single attack.
However, after every attack Genos makes, the monsters advance. With their combined efforts, they reduce Genos' attack damage by the power of the
†
†
weakest monster
‡
‡
alive. In other words, the minimum
p
i
among all currently living monsters is subtracted from the value of
k
after each attack.
†
†
The Weakest monster is the one with the least power.
‡
‡
A monster is alive if its health is strictly greater than
0
.
Will Genos be successful in killing all the monsters?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers,
n
and
k
(
1≤n,k≤
10
5
) — the number of monsters and Genos' initial attack damage. Then two lines follow, each containing
n
integers describing the arrays
h
and
p
(
1≤
h
i
,
p
i
≤
10
9
).
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print the answer — "YES" (without quotes) if Genos could kill all monsters and "NO" otherwise.

Note
In the first example, after Genos' first attack,
h
and
k
will update to:
h:[11,0,6,2,3,0]
k:7−1=6
After second attack:
h:[5,0,0,0,0,0]
k:6−2=4
After third attack:
h:[1,0,0,0,0,0]
k:4−2=2
After fourth attack:
h:[0,0,0,0,0,0]
As Genos could kill all monsters, the answer is YES.
