Polycarp likes numbers that are divisible by 3.
He has a huge number
s
. Polycarp wants to cut from it the maximum number of numbers that are divisible by
3
. To do this, he makes an arbitrary number of vertical cuts between pairs of adjacent digits. As a result, after
m
such cuts, there will be
m+1
parts in total. Polycarp analyzes each of the obtained numbers and finds the number of those that are divisible by
3
.
For example, if the original number is
s=3121
, then Polycarp can cut it into three parts with two cuts:
3|1|21
. As a result, he will get two numbers that are divisible by
3
.
Polycarp can make an arbitrary number of vertical cuts, where each cut is made between a pair of adjacent digits. The resulting numbers cannot contain extra leading zeroes (that is, the number can begin with 0 if and only if this number is exactly one character '0'). For example, 007, 01 and 00099 are not valid numbers, but 90, 0 and 10001 are valid.
What is the maximum number of numbers divisible by
3
that Polycarp can obtain?
Input
The first line of the input contains a positive integer
s
. The number of digits of the number
s
is between
1
and
2â‹…
10
5
, inclusive. The first (leftmost) digit is not equal to 0.
Output
Print the maximum number of numbers divisible by
3
that Polycarp can get by making vertical cuts in the given number
s
.

Note
In the first example, an example set of optimal cuts on the number is 3|1|21.
In the second example, you do not need to make any cuts. The specified number 6 forms one number that is divisible by
3
.
In the third example, cuts must be made between each pair of digits. As a result, Polycarp gets one digit 1 and
33
digits 0. Each of the
33
digits 0 forms a number that is divisible by
3
.
In the fourth example, an example set of optimal cuts is 2|0|1|9|201|81. The numbers
0
,
9
,
201
and
81
are divisible by
3
.
