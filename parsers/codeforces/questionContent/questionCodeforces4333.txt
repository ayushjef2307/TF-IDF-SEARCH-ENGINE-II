Little girl Tanya climbs the stairs inside a multi-storey building. Every time Tanya climbs a stairway, she starts counting steps from
1
to the number of steps in this stairway. She speaks every number aloud. For example, if she climbs two stairways, the first of which contains
3
steps, and the second contains
4
steps, she will pronounce the numbers
1,2,3,1,2,3,4
.
You are given all the numbers pronounced by Tanya. How many stairways did she climb? Also, output the number of steps in each stairway.
The given sequence will be a valid sequence that Tanya could have pronounced when climbing one or more stairways.
