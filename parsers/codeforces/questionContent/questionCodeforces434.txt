You are given an array
a
of length
n
. You can perform the following operation several (possibly, zero) times:
Choose
i
,
j
,
b
: Swap the
b
-th digit in the binary representation of
a
i
and
a
j
.
Find the maximum possible value of
max(a)−min(a)
.
In a binary representation, bits are numbered from right (least significant) to left (most significant). Consider that there are an infinite number of leading zero bits at the beginning of any binary representation.
For example, swap the
0
-th bit for
4=
100
2
and
3=
11
2
will result
101
2
=5
and
10
2
=2
. Swap the
2
-nd bit for
4=
100
2
and
3=
11
2
will result
000
2
=
0
2
=0
and
111
2
=7
.
Here,
max(a)
denotes the maximum element of array
a
and
min(a)
denotes the minimum element of array
a
.
The binary representation of
x
is
x
written in base
2
. For example,
9
and
6
written in base
2
are
1001
and
110
, respectively.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤128
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤512
) — the length of array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
<1024
) — the elements of array
a
.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all testcases does not exceed
512
.
Output
For each testcase, print one integer — the maximum possible value of
max(a)−min(a)
.

Note
In the first example, it can be shown that we do not need to perform any operations — the maximum value of
max(a)−min(a)
is
1−0=1
.
In the second example, no operation can change the array — the maximum value of
max(a)−min(a)
is
5−5=0
.
In the third example, initially
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
, we can perform one operation taking
i=2
,
j=5
,
b=1
. The array now becomes
a=[1,0,3,4,7]
. It can be shown that any further operations do not lead to a better answer — therefore the answer is
max(a)−min(a)=7−0=7
.
