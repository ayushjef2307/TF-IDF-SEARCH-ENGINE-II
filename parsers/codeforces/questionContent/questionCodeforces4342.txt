Polycarp has
n
coins, the value of the
i
-th coin is
a
i
. It is guaranteed that all the values are integer powers of
2
(i.e.
a
i
=
2
d
for some non-negative integer number
d
).
Polycarp wants to know answers on
q
queries. The
j
-th query is described as integer number
b
j
. The answer to the query is the minimum number of coins that is necessary to obtain the value
b
j
using some subset of coins (Polycarp can use only coins he has). If Polycarp can't obtain the value
b
j
, the answer to the
j
-th query is -1.
The queries are independent (the answer on the query doesn't affect Polycarp's coins).
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of coins and the number of queries.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
— values of coins (
1≤
a
i
≤2⋅
10
9
). It is guaranteed that all
a
i
are integer powers of
2
(i.e.
a
i
=
2
d
for some non-negative integer number
d
).
The next
q
lines contain one integer each. The
j
-th line contains one integer
b
j
— the value of the
j
-th query (
1≤
b
j
≤
10
9
).
Output
Print
q
integers
an
s
j
. The
j
-th integer must be equal to the answer on the
j
-th query. If Polycarp can't obtain the value
b
j
the answer to the
j
-th query is -1.
