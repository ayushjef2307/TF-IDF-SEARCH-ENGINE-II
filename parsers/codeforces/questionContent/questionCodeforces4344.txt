You are given three integers
a
,
b
and
x
. Your task is to construct a binary string
s
of length
n=a+b
such that there are exactly
a
zeroes, exactly
b
ones and exactly
x
indices
i
(where
1≤i<n
) such that
s
i
≠
s
i+1
. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.
For example, for the string "01010" there are four indices
i
such that
1≤i<n
and
s
i
≠
s
i+1
(
i=1,2,3,4
). For the string "111001" there are two such indices
i
(
i=3,5
).
Recall that binary string is a non-empty sequence of characters where each character is either 0 or 1.
Input
The first line of the input contains three integers
a
,
b
and
x
(
1≤a,b≤100,1≤x<a+b)
.
Output
Print only one string
s
, where
s
is any binary string satisfying conditions described above. It is guaranteed that the answer always exists.
