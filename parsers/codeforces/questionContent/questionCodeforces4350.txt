Implement a quantum oracle on N qubits which implements the following function: , where (a vector of N integers, each of which can be 0 or 1).
For an explanation on how this type of quantum oracles works, see Introduction to quantum oracles.
You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:
an array of N qubits x in arbitrary state (input register), 1 ≤ N ≤ 8,
a qubit y in arbitrary state (output qubit),
an array of N integers b, representing the vector . Each element of b will be 0 or 1.
The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit, b : Int[]) : ()
    {
        body
        {
            // your code here
        }
    }
}
