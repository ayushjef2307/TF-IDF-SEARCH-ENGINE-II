You are given 2 qubits which are guaranteed to be in one of the four orthogonal states:
Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return the index of that state (0 for , 1 for etc.). The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.
You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 2 qubits as an input and returns an integer.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int
    {
        body
        {
            // your code here
        }
    }
}
