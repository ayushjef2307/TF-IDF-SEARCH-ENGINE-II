You are given N qubits (2 ≤ N ≤ 8) which are guaranteed to be in one of the two states:
state, or
state.
Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 0 if it was state or 1 if it was W state. The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.
You have to implement an operation which takes an array of N qubits as an input and returns an integer.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int
    {
        body
        {
            // your code here
        }
    }
}
