You are given N qubits (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) in zero state . You are also given two bitstrings bits0 and bits1 which describe two different basis states on N qubits and .
Your task is to generate a state which is an equal superposition of the given basis states:
You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:
an array of qubits qs,
two arrays of Boolean values bits0 and bits1 representing the basis states and . These arrays will have the same length as the array of qubits. bits0 and bits1 will differ in at least one position.
The operation doesn't have an output; its "output" is the state in which it leaves the qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[], bits0 : Bool[], bits1 : Bool[]) : ()
    {
        body
        {
            // your code here
        }
    }
}
