You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers and an integer
k
.
A pair
(l,r)
is good if there exists a sequence of indices
i
1
,
i
2
,…,
i
m
such that
i

=l
and
i

=r

.
Find the number of pairs
(l,r)
(
1≤l≤r≤n
) that are good.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
;
0≤k≤
10
5
) — the length of the array
a
and the integer
k
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
space-separated integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10

) — representing the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print the number of good pairs.

Note
In the first test case, good pairs are
(1,1)
,
(1,2)
,
(1,3)
,
(2,2)
,
(2,3)
, and
(3,3)
.
In the second test case, good pairs are
(1,1)
,
(1,3)
,
(1,4)
,
(2,2)
,
(2,3)
,
(2,4)
,
(3,3)
,
(3,4)
and
(4,4)
. Pair
(1,4)
is good because there exists a sequence of indices
1,3,4
which satisfy the given conditions.
