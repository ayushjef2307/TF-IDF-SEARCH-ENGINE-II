You are given N qubits (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) in zero state .
Your task is to generate an equal superposition of all 2N basis vectors on N qubits:
For example,
for N = 1, the required state is simply ,
for N = 2, the required state is .
You have to implement an operation which takes an array of N qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of the operation is the state in which it leaves the qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : ()
    {
        body
        {
            // your code here
        }
    }
}
