Implement a quantum oracle on N qubits which implements the following function: , i.e., the value of the function is 1 if x has odd number of 1s, and 0 otherwise.
Input
You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:
an array of qubits x (input register),
a qubit y (output qubit).
The operation doesn't have an output; the "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit) : ()
    {
        body
        {
            // your code here
        }
    }
}
