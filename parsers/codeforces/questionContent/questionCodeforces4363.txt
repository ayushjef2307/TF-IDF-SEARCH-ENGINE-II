Implement a quantum oracle on N qubits which implements a function f(x) = xk, i.e. the value of the function is the value of the k-th qubit.
For an explanation on how the quantum oracles work, see the tutorial blog post.
Input
You have to implement an operation which takes the following inputs:
an array of qubits x (input register),
a qubit y (output qubit),
0-based index of the qubit from input register K ().
The operation doesn't have an output; the "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (x : Qubit[], y : Qubit, k : Int) : ()
    {
        body
        {
            // your code here
        }
    }
}
