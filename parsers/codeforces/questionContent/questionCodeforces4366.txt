You are given a qubit which is guaranteed to be either in or in state.
Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 1 if it was a state or -1 if it was state. The state of the qubit after the operations does not matter.
Input
You have to implement an operation which takes a qubit as an input and returns an integer.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (q : Qubit) : Int
    {
        body
        {
            // your code here
        }
    }
}
