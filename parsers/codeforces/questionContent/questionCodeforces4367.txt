You are given N qubits (1 ≤ N ≤ 8) in zero state . Your task is to create Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) state on them:
Note that for N = 1 and N = 2 GHZ state becomes states and from the previous tasks, respectively.
Input
You have to implement an operation which takes an array of N qubits as an input and has no output. The "output" of your solution is the state in which it left the input qubits.
Your code should have the following signature:
namespace Solution {
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;
    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;

    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : ()
    {
        body
        {
            // your code here
        }
    }
}
