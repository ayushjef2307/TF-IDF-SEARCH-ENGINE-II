You are given a weighted tree (undirected connected graph with no cycles, loops or multiple edges) with
n
vertices. The edge
{
u
j
,
v
j
}
has weight
w
j
. Also each vertex
i
has its own value
a
i
assigned to it.
Let's call a path starting in vertex
u
and ending in vertex
v
, where each edge can appear no more than twice (regardless of direction), a 2-path. Vertices can appear in the 2-path multiple times (even start and end vertices).
For some 2-path
p
profit
Pr(p)=
∑
v∈distinct vertices in p
a
v
−
∑
e∈distinct edges in p
k
e
⋅
w
e
, where
k
e
is the number of times edge
e
appears in
p
. That is, vertices are counted once, but edges are counted the number of times they appear in
p
.
You are about to answer
m
queries. Each query is a pair of vertices
(qu,qv)
. For each query find 2-path
p
from
qu
to
qv
with maximal profit
Pr(p)
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n≤3⋅
10
5
,
1≤q≤4⋅
10
5
) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n
space-separated integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
)
— the values of the vertices.
Next
n−1
lines contain descriptions of edges: each line contains three space separated integers
u
i
,
v
i
and
w
i
(
1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n
,
u
i
≠
v
i
,
1≤
w
i
≤
10
9
) — there is edge
{
u
i
,
v
i
}
with weight
w
i
in the tree.
Next
q
lines contain queries (one per line). Each query contains two integers
q
u
i
and
q
v
i
(1≤q
u
i
,q
v
i
≤n)
— endpoints of the 2-path you need to find.
Output
For each query print one integer per line — maximal profit
Pr(p)
of the some 2-path
p
with the corresponding endpoints.
