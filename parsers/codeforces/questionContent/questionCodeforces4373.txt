The sequence of integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
k
is called a good array if
a
1
=k−1
and
a
1
>0
. For example, the sequences
[3,−1,44,0],[1,−99]
are good arrays, and the sequences
[3,7,8],[2,5,4,1],[0]
— are not.
A sequence of integers is called good if it can be divided into a positive number of good arrays. Each good array should be a subsegment of sequence and each element of the sequence should belong to exactly one array. For example, the sequences
[2,−3,0,1,4]
,
[1,2,3,−3,−9,4]
are good, and the sequences
[2,−3,0,1]
,
[1,2,3,−3−9,4,1]
— are not.
For a given sequence of numbers, count the number of its subsequences that are good sequences, and print the number of such subsequences modulo 998244353.
Input
The first line contains the number
n (1≤n≤
10
3
)
— the length of the initial sequence. The following line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
 (−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
)
— the sequence itself.
Output
In the single line output one integer — the number of subsequences of the original sequence that are good sequences, taken modulo 998244353.

Note
In the first test case, two good subsequences —
[
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
]
and
[
a

a

]
.
In the second test case, seven good subsequences —
