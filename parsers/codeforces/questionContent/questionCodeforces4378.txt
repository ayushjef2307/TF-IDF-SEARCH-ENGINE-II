There are
n
cities and
m
roads in Berland. Each road connects a pair of cities. The roads in Berland are one-way.
What is the minimum number of new roads that need to be built to make all the cities reachable from the capital?
New roads will also be one-way.
Input
The first line of input consists of three integers
n
,
m
and
s
(
1≤n≤5000,0≤m≤5000,1≤s≤n
) — the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital. Cities are indexed from
1
to
n
.
The following
m
lines contain roads: road
i
is given as a pair of cities
u
i
,
v
i
(
1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n
,
u
i
≠
v
i
). For each pair of cities
(u,v)
, there can be at most one road from
u
to
v
. Roads in opposite directions between a pair of cities are allowed (i.e. from
u
to
v
and from
v
to
u
).
Output
Print one integer — the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from city
s
. If all the cities are already reachable from
s
, print 0.

Note
The first example is illustrated by the following:
For example, you can add roads (
6,4
), (
7,9
), (
1,7
) to make all the cities reachable from
s=1
.
The second example is illustrated by the following:
In this example, you can add any one of the roads (
5,1
), (
5,2
), (
5,3
), (
5,4
) to make all the cities reachable from
s=5
.
