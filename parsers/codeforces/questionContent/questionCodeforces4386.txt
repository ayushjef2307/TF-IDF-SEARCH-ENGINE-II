Consider a tree (that is, an undirected connected graph without loops)
T
1
and a tree
T
2
. Let's define their cartesian product
T
1
×
T
2
in a following way.
Let
V
be the set of vertices in
T
1
and
U
be the set of vertices in
T
2
.
Then the set of vertices of graph
T
1
×
T
2
is
V×U
, that is, a set of ordered pairs of vertices, where the first vertex in pair is from
V
and the second — from
U
.
Let's draw the following edges:
Between
(v,
u
1
)
and
(v,
u
2
)
there is an undirected edge, if
u
1
and
u
2
are adjacent in
U
.
Similarly, between
(
v
1
,u)
and
(
v
2
,u)
there is an undirected edge, if
v
1
and
v
2
are adjacent in
V
.
Please see the notes section for the pictures of products of trees in the sample tests.
Let's examine the graph
T
1
×
T
2
. How much cycles (not necessarily simple) of length
k
it contains? Since this number can be very large, print it modulo
998244353
.
The sequence of vertices
w
1
,
w
2
, ...,
w
k
, where
w
i
∈V×U
called cycle, if any neighboring vertices are adjacent and
w
1
is adjacent to
w
k
. Cycles that differ only by the cyclic shift or direction of traversal are still considered different.
Input
First line of input contains three integers —
n
1
,
n
2
and
k
(
2≤
n
1
,
n
2
≤4000
,
2≤k≤75
) — number of vertices in the first tree, number of vertices in the second tree and the cycle length respectively.
Then follow
n
1
−1
lines describing the first tree. Each of this lines contains two integers —
v
i
,
u
i
(
1≤
v
i
,
u
i
≤
n
1
), which define edges of the first tree.
Then follow
n
2
−1
lines, which describe the second tree in the same format.
It is guaranteed, that given graphs are trees.
Output
Print one integer — number of cycles modulo
998244353
.

Note
The following three pictures illustrate graph, which are products of the trees from sample tests.
In the first example, the list of cycles of length
2
is as follows:
«AB», «BA»
«BC», «CB»
«AD», «DA»
«CD», «DC»
