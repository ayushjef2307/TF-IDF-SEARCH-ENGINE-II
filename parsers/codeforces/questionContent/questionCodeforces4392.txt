Allen, having graduated from the MOO Institute of Techcowlogy (MIT), has started a startup! Allen is the president of his startup. He also hires
n−1
other employees, each of which is assigned a direct superior. If
u
is a superior of
v
and
v
is a superior of
w
then also
u
is a superior of
w
. Additionally, there are no
u
and
v
such that
u
is the superior of
v
and
v
is the superior of
u
. Allen himself has no superior. Allen is employee number
1
, and the others are employee numbers
2
through
n
.
Finally, Allen must assign salaries to each employee in the company including himself. Due to budget constraints, each employee's salary is an integer between
1
and
D
. Additionally, no employee can make strictly more than his superior.
Help Allen find the number of ways to assign salaries. As this number may be large, output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
D
(
1≤n≤3000
,
1≤D≤
10
9
).
The remaining
n−1
lines each contain a single positive integer, where the
i
-th line contains the integer
p
i
(
1≤
p
i
≤i
).
p
i
denotes the direct superior of employee
i+1
.
Output
Output a single integer: the number of ways to assign salaries modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
In the first sample case, employee 2 and 3 report directly to Allen. The three salaries, in order, can be
(1,1,1)
,
(2,1,1)
,
(2,1,2)
,
(2,2,1)
or
(2,2,2)
.
In the second sample case, employee 2 reports to Allen and employee 3 reports to employee 2. In order, the possible salaries are

(2,1,1)
,
(2,2,1)
,
(2,2,2)
