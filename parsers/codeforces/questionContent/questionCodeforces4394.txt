Allen and Bessie are playing a simple number game. They both know a function
f:{0,1
}
n
→R
, i. e. the function takes
n
binary arguments and returns a real value. At the start of the game, the variables
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
are all set to
−1
. Each round, with equal probability, one of Allen or Bessie gets to make a move. A move consists of picking an
i
such that
x
i
=−1
and either setting
x
i
→0
or
x
i
→1
.
After
n
rounds all variables are set, and the game value resolves to
f(
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
)
. Allen wants to maximize the game value, and Bessie wants to minimize it.
Your goal is to help Allen and Bessie find the expected game value! They will play
r+1
times though, so between each game, exactly one value of
f
changes. In other words, between rounds
i
and
i+1
for
1≤i≤r
,
f(
z
1
,…,
z
n
)→
g
i
for some
(
z
1
,…,
z
n
)∈{0,1
}
n
. You are to find the expected game value in the beginning and after each change.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
r
(
1≤n≤18
,
0≤r≤
2
18
).
The next line contains
2

integers
c
0
,
c
1
,…,
c
2
n
−1
(
0≤
c
i
≤
10
9
), denoting the initial values of
f
. More specifically,
f(
x
0
,
x
1
,…,
x
n−1
)=
c
x
, if
x=
x
n−1
…

Output
Print
r+1
lines, the
i
-th of which denotes the value of the game
f
during the
i
-th round. Your answer must have absolute or relative error within
10
−6
.
Formally, let your answer be
a
, and the jury's answer be
b
. Your answer is considered correct if
|a−b|
max(1,|b|)
≤
10
−6
.

Note
Consider the second test case. If Allen goes first, he will set
x
1
→1
, so the final value will be
3
. If Bessie goes first, then she will set
x
1
→0
so the final value will be
2
. Thus the answer is
2.5
.
In the third test case, the game value will always be
1
regardless of Allen and Bessie's play.
