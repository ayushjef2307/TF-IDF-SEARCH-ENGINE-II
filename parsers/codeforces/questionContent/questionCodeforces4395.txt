Allen had a bit too much to drink at the bar, which is at the origin. There are
n
vectors
v
1
→
,
v
2
→
,⋯,
v
n
→
. Allen will make
n
moves. As Allen's sense of direction is impaired, during the
i
-th move he will either move in the direction
v
i
→
or
−
v
i
→
. In other words, if his position is currently
p=(x,y)
, he will either move to
p+
v
i
→
or
p−
v
i
→
.
Allen doesn't want to wander too far from home (which happens to also be the bar). You need to help him figure out a sequence of moves (a sequence of signs for the vectors) such that his final position
p
satisfies
|p|≤1.5⋅
10
6
so that he can stay safe.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of moves.
Each of the following lines contains two space-separated integers
x
i
and
y
i
, meaning that
v
i
→
=(
x
i
,
y
i
)
. We have that
|
v
i
|≤
10
6
for all
i
.
Output
Output a single line containing

c

c

c

, each of which is either
1

v

It can be shown that a solution always exists under the given constraints.
