Vasya is a regular participant at programming contests and is already experienced in finding important sentences in long statements. Of course, numbers constraints are important — factorization of a number less than 1000000 is easier than of a number less than 1000000000. However, sometimes it's hard to understand the number at the first glance. Could it be shortened? For example, instead of 1000000 you could write
10
6
, instead of 1000000000  —
10
9
, instead of 1000000007 —
10
9
+7
.
Vasya decided that, to be concise, the notation should follow several rules:
the notation should only consist of numbers, operations of addition ("+"), multiplication ("*") and exponentiation ("^"), in particular, the use of braces is forbidden;
the use of several exponentiation operations in a row is forbidden, for example, writing "2^3^4" is unacceptable;
the value of the resulting expression equals to the initial number;
the notation should consist of the minimal amount of symbols.
Given
n
, find the equivalent concise notation for it.
Input
The only line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤10000000000
).
Output
Output a concise notation of the number
n
. If there are several concise notations, output any of them.
