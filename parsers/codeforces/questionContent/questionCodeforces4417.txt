You are given a tree consisting of
n
vertices. A number is written on each vertex; the number on vertex
i
is equal to
a
i
.
Let's denote the function
g(x,y)
as the greatest common divisor of the numbers written on the vertices belonging to the simple path from vertex
x
to vertex
y
(including these two vertices).
For every integer from
1
to
2⋅
10
5
you have to count the number of pairs
(x,y)
(1≤x≤y≤n)
such that
g(x,y)
is equal to this number.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
— the number of vertices
(1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
)
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
n
(1≤
a
i
≤2⋅
10
5
)
— the numbers written on vertices.
Then
n−1
lines follow, each containing two integers
x
and
y
(1≤x,y≤n,x≠y)
denoting an edge connecting vertex
x
with vertex
y
. It is guaranteed that these edges form a tree.
Output
For every integer
i
from
1
to
2⋅
10
5
do the following: if there is no pair
(x,y)
such that
x≤y
and
g(x,y)=i
, don't output anything. Otherwise output two integers:
i
and the number of aforementioned pairs. You have to consider the values of
i
in ascending order.
See the examples for better understanding.
