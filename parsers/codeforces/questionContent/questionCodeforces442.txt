This in an interactive problem.
There is an unknown tree consisting of
n
nodes, which has exactly one centroid. You only know
n
at first, and your task is to find the centroid of the tree.
You can ask the distance between any two vertices for at most
2⋅
10
5
times.
Note that the interactor is not adaptive. That is, the tree is fixed in each test beforehand and does not depend on your queries.
A vertex is called a centroid if its removal splits the tree into subtrees with at most
⌊
n
2
⌋
vertices each.
Input
The only line of the input contains an integer
n
(
3≤n≤7.5⋅
10
4
) — the number of nodes in the tree.
Interaction
Start interaction by reading
n
.
To ask a query about the distance between two nodes
u,v
(
1≤u,v≤n
), output "? u v".
If you determine that the centroid of the tree is
x
, use "! x" to report.
After printing a query, do not forget to output the end of a line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:
fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++;
System.out.flush() in Java;
flush(output) in Pascal;
stdout.flush() in Python;
see documentation for other languages.
Hacks are disabled in this problem.
It's guaranteed that there are at most
