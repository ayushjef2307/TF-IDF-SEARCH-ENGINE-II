You are given
n
strings. Each string consists of lowercase English letters. Rearrange (reorder) the given strings in such a way that for every string, all strings that are placed before it are its substrings.
String
a
is a substring of string
b
if it is possible to choose several consecutive letters in
b
in such a way that they form
a
. For example, string "for" is contained as a substring in strings "codeforces", "for" and "therefore", but is not contained as a substring in strings "four", "fofo" and "rof".
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the number of strings.
The next
n
lines contain the given strings. The number of letters in each string is from
1
to
100
, inclusive. Each string consists of lowercase English letters.
Some strings might be equal.
Output
If it is impossible to reorder
n
given strings in required order, print "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) and
n
given strings in required order.
