It is the middle of 2018 and Maria Stepanovna, who lives outside Krasnokamensk (a town in Zabaikalsky region), wants to rent three displays to highlight an important problem.
There are
n
displays placed along a road, and the
i
-th of them can display a text with font size
s
i
only. Maria Stepanovna wants to rent such three displays with indices
i<j<k
that the font size increases if you move along the road in a particular direction. Namely, the condition
s
i
<
s
j
<
s
k
should be held.
The rent cost is for the
i
-th display is
c
i
. Please determine the smallest cost Maria Stepanovna should pay.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤3000
) — the number of displays.
The second line contains
n
integers
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
n
(
1≤
s
i
≤
10
9
) — the font sizes on the displays in the order they stand along the road.
The third line contains
n
integers
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
n
(
1≤
c
i
≤
10
8
) — the rent costs for each display.
Output
If there are no three displays that satisfy the criteria, print -1. Otherwise print a single integer — the minimum total rent cost of three displays with indices
i<j<k
such that
s
i
<
s
j
<
s
k
.

Note
In the first example you can, for example, choose displays
1
,
4
and
5
, because
s
1
<
s
4
<
s
5
(
2<4<10
), and the rent cost is
40+10+40=90
.
In the second example you can't select a valid triple of indices, so the answer is -1.
