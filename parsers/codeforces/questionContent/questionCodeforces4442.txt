Petr likes to come up with problems about randomly generated data. This time problem is about random permutation. He decided to generate a random permutation this way: he takes identity permutation of numbers from
1
to
n
and then
3n
times takes a random pair of different elements and swaps them. Alex envies Petr and tries to imitate him in all kind of things. Alex has also come up with a problem about random permutation. He generates a random permutation just like Petr but swaps elements
7n+1
times instead of
3n
times. Because it is more random, OK?!
You somehow get a test from one of these problems and now you want to know from which one.
Input
In the first line of input there is one integer
n
(
10
3
≤n≤
10
6
).
In the second line there are
n
distinct integers between
1
and
n
 — the permutation of size
n
from the test.
It is guaranteed that all tests except for sample are generated this way: First we choose
n
 — the size of the permutation. Then we randomly choose a method to generate a permutation — the one of Petr or the one of Alex. Then we generate a permutation using chosen method.
Output
If the test is generated via Petr's method print "Petr" (without quotes). If the test is generated via Alex's method print "Um_nik" (without quotes).

Note
Please note that the sample is not a valid test (because of limitations for
n
) and is given only to illustrate input/output format. Your program still has to print correct answer to this test to get AC.
Due to randomness of input hacks in this problem are forbidden.
