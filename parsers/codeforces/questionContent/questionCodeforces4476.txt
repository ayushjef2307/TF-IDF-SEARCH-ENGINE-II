The city of Fishtopia can be imagined as a grid of
4
rows and an odd number of columns. It has two main villages; the first is located at the top-left cell
(1,1)
, people who stay there love fishing at the Tuna pond at the bottom-right cell
(4,n)
. The second village is located at
(4,1)
and its people love the Salmon pond at
(1,n)
.
The mayor of Fishtopia wants to place
k
hotels in the city, each one occupying one cell. To allow people to enter the city from anywhere, hotels should not be placed on the border cells.
A person can move from one cell to another if those cells are not occupied by hotels and share a side.
Can you help the mayor place the hotels in a way such that there are equal number of shortest paths from each village to its preferred pond?
Input
The first line of input contain two integers,
n
and
k
(
3≤n≤99
,
0≤k≤2×(n−2)
),
n
is odd, the width of the city, and the number of hotels to be placed, respectively.
Output
Print "YES", if it is possible to place all the hotels in a way that satisfies the problem statement, otherwise print "NO".
If it is possible, print an extra
4
lines that describe the city, each line should have
n
characters, each of which is "#" if that cell has a hotel on it, or "." if not.
