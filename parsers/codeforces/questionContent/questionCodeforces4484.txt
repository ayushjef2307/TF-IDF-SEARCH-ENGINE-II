In BerSoft
n
programmers work, the programmer
i
is characterized by a skill
r
i
.
A programmer
a
can be a mentor of a programmer
b
if and only if the skill of the programmer
a
is strictly greater than the skill of the programmer
b
(
r
a
>
r
b
)
and programmers
a
and
b
are not in a quarrel.
You are given the skills of each programmers and a list of
k
pairs of the programmers, which are in a quarrel (pairs are unordered). For each programmer
i
, find the number of programmers, for which the programmer
i
can be a mentor.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
0≤k≤min(2⋅
10
5
,
n⋅(n−1)
2
))
— total number of programmers and number of pairs of programmers which are in a quarrel.
The second line contains a sequence of integers
r
1
,
r
2
,…,
r
n
(1≤
r
i
≤
10
9
)
, where
r
i
equals to the skill of the
i
-th programmer.
Each of the following
k
lines contains two distinct integers
x
,
y
(1≤x,y≤n
,
x≠y)
— pair of programmers in a quarrel. The pairs are unordered, it means that if
x
is in a quarrel with
y
then
y
is in a quarrel with
x
. Guaranteed, that for each pair
(x,y)
there are no other pairs
(x,y)
and
(y,x)
in the input.
Output
Print
n
integers, the
i
-th number should be equal to the number of programmers, for which the
i
-th programmer can be a mentor. Programmers are numbered in the same order that their skills are given in the input.

Note
In the first example, the first programmer can not be mentor of any other (because only the second programmer has a skill, lower than first programmer skill, but they are in a quarrel). The second programmer can not be mentor of any other programmer, because his skill is minimal among others. The third programmer can be a mentor of the second programmer. The fourth programmer can be a mentor of the first and of the second programmers. He can not be a mentor of the third programmer, because they are in a quarrel.
