You are given three integers
n
,
a
, and
b
. Determine if there exist two permutations
p
and
q
of length
n
, for which the following conditions hold:
The length of the longest common prefix of
p
and
q
is
a
.
The length of the longest common suffix of
p
and
q
is
b
.
A permutation of length
n
is an array containing each integer from
1
to
n
exactly once. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array), and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
a
, and
b
(
1≤a,b≤n≤100
).
Output
For each test case, if such a pair of permutations exists, output "Yes"; otherwise, output "No". You can output each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Yes
Note
In the first test case,
[1]
and
[1]
form a valid pair.
In the second test case and the third case, we can show that such a pair of permutations doesn't exist.
In the fourth test case,
[1,2,3,4]
and
[1,3,2,4]
form a valid pair.
