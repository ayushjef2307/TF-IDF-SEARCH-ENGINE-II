You are given a sequence of n positive integers d1, d2, ..., dn (d1 < d2 < ... < dn). Your task is to construct an undirected graph such that:
there are exactly dn + 1 vertices;
there are no self-loops;
there are no multiple edges;
there are no more than 106 edges;
its degree set is equal to d.
Vertices should be numbered 1 through (dn + 1).
Degree sequence is an array a with length equal to the number of vertices in a graph such that ai is the number of vertices adjacent to i-th vertex.
Degree set is a sorted in increasing order sequence of all distinct values from the degree sequence.
It is guaranteed that there exists such a graph that all the conditions hold, and it contains no more than 106 edges.
Print the resulting graph.
Input
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 300) — the size of the degree set.
The second line contains n integers d1, d2, ..., dn (1 ≤ di ≤ 1000, d1 < d2 < ... < dn) — the degree set.
Output
In the first line print one integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 106) — the number of edges in the resulting graph. It is guaranteed that there exists such a graph that all the conditions hold and it contains no more than 106 edges.
Each of the next m lines should contain two integers vi and ui (1 ≤ vi, ui ≤ dn + 1) — the description of the i-th edge.
