LuoTianyi is watching the anime Made in Abyss. She finds that making a Cartridge is interesting. To describe the process of making a Cartridge more clearly, she abstracts the original problem and gives you the following problem.
You are given a tree
T
consisting of
n
vertices. Each vertex has values
a
i
and
b
i
and each edge has values
c
j
and
d
j
.
Now you are aim to build a tree
T
′
as follows:
First, select
p
vertices from
T
(
p
is a number chosen by yourself) as the vertex set
S
′
of
T
′
.
Next, select
p−1
edges from
T
one by one (you cannot select one edge more than once).
May you have chosen the
j
-th edge connects vertices
x
j
and
y
j
with values
(
c
j
,
d
j
)
, then you can choose two vertices
u
and
v
in
S
′
that satisfy the edge
(
x
j
,
y
j
)
is contained in the simple path from
u
to
v
in
T
, and link
u
and
v
in
T
′
by the edge with values
(
c
j
,
d
j
)
(
u
and
v
shouldn't be contained in one connected component before in
T
′
).
A tree with three vertices,
min(A,C)=1,B+D=7
, the cost is
7
.
Selected vertices
2
and
3
as
S
′
, used the edge
(1,2)
with
c
j
=2
and
d
j
=1
to link this vertices, now
min(A,C)=2,B+D=4
, the cost is
8
.
Let
A
be the minimum of values
a
i
in
T
′
and
C
be the minimum of values
c
i
in
T
′
. Let
B
be the sum of
b
i
in
T
′
and
D
be the sum of values
d
i
in
T
′
. Let
min(A,C)⋅(B+D)
be the cost of
T
′
. You need to find the maximum possible cost of
T
′
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of vertices in the tree
T
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤2⋅
10
5
), where the
i
-th integer represents the
a
i
value of the
i
-th vertex.
The third line contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤2⋅
10
5
), where the
i
-th integer represents the
b
i
value of the
i
-th vertex.
Then
n−1
lines follow, the
j
-th of them contains four integers
x
j
,
y
j
,
c
j
,
d
j
(
1≤
x
j
,
y
j
≤n,1≤
c
j
,
d
j
≤2⋅
10
5
) representing the edge
(
x
j
,
y
j
)
and its values
c
j
and
d
j
respectively. It's guaranteed that edges form a tree.
Output
Print a single integer — the maximum possible cost of
T
′
.

Note
The tree from the first example is shown in the statement.
The tree from the second example is shown below:
A=1,B=18,C=1,D=17
, so the cost is
min(1,1)⋅(18+17)=35
.
