Mancala is a game famous in the Middle East. It is played on a board that consists of 14 holes.
Initially, each hole has
a
i
stones. When a player makes a move, he chooses a hole which contains a positive number of stones. He takes all the stones inside it and then redistributes these stones one by one in the next holes in a counter-clockwise direction.
Note that the counter-clockwise order means if the player takes the stones from hole
i
, he will put one stone in the
(i+1)
-th hole, then in the
(i+2)
-th, etc. If he puts a stone in the
14
-th hole, the next one will be put in the first hole.
After the move, the player collects all the stones from holes that contain even number of stones. The number of stones collected by player is the score, according to Resli.
Resli is a famous Mancala player. He wants to know the maximum score he can obtain after one move.
