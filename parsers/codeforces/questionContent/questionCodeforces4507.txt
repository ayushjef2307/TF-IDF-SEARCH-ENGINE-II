Arkady wants to water his only flower. Unfortunately, he has a very poor watering system that was designed for
n
flowers and so it looks like a pipe with
n
holes. Arkady can only use the water that flows from the first hole.
Arkady can block some of the holes, and then pour
A
liters of water into the pipe. After that, the water will flow out from the non-blocked holes proportionally to their sizes
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
n
. In other words, if the sum of sizes of non-blocked holes is
S
, and the
i
-th hole is not blocked,
s
i
⋅A
S
liters of water will flow out of it.
What is the minimum number of holes Arkady should block to make at least
B
liters of water flow out of the first hole?
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
A
,
B
(
1≤n≤100000
,
1≤B≤A≤
10
4
) — the number of holes, the volume of water Arkady will pour into the system, and the volume he wants to get out of the first hole.
The second line contains
n
integers
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
n
(
1≤
s
i
≤
10
4
) — the sizes of the holes.
Output
Print a single integer — the number of holes Arkady should block.

Note
In the first example Arkady should block at least one hole. After that,
10⋅2
6
≈3.333
liters of water will flow out of the first hole, and that suits Arkady.
In the second example even without blocking any hole,
80⋅3
10
=24
liters will flow out of the first hole, that is not less than
20
.
In the third example Arkady has to block all holes except the first to make all water flow out of the first hole.
