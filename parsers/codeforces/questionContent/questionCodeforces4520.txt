You are given two integers
a
and
b
. Moreover, you are given a sequence
s
0
,
s
1
,…,
s
n
. All values in
s
are integers
1
or
−1
. It's known that sequence is
k
-periodic and
k
divides
n+1
. In other words, for each
k≤i≤n
it's satisfied that
s
i
=
s
i−k
.
Find out the non-negative remainder of division of
∑

.
Note that the modulo is unusual!
Input
The first line contains four integers
n,a,b
and
k
(1≤n≤
10
9
,1≤a,b≤
10
9
,1≤k≤
10
5
)
.
The second line contains a sequence of length
k
consisting of characters '+' and '-'.
If the
i
-th character (0-indexed) is '+', then
s
i
=1
, otherwise
s
i
=−1
.
Note that only the first
k
members of the sequence are given, the rest can be obtained using the periodicity property.
Output
Output a single integer — value of given expression modulo
