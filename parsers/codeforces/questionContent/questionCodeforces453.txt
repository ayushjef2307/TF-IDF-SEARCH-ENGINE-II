You are given an array
a[0…n−1]
of
n
integers. This array is called a "valley" if there exists exactly one subarray
a[l…r]
such that:
0≤l≤r≤n−1
,
a
l
=
a
l+1
=
a
l+2
=⋯=
a
r
,
l=0
or
a
l−1
>
a
l
,
r=n−1
or
a
r
<
a
r+1
.
Here are three examples:
The first image shows the array [
3,2,2,1,2,2,3
], it is a valley because only subarray with indices
l=r=3
satisfies the condition.
The second image shows the array [
1,1,1,2,3,3,4,5,6,6,6
], it is a valley because only subarray with indices
l=0,r=2
satisfies the codition.
The third image shows the array [
1,2,3,4,3,2,1
], it is not a valley because two subarrays
l=r=0
and
l=r=6
that satisfy the condition.
You are asked whether the given array is a valley or not.
Note that we consider the array to be indexed from
0
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases is smaller than
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if the array is a valley, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).
