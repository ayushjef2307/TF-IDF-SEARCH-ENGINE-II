A sequence of
n
numbers is called permutation if it contains all numbers from
1
to
n
exactly once. For example, the sequences [
3,1,4,2
], [
1
] and [
2,1
] are permutations, but [
1,2,1
], [
0,1
] and [
1,3,4
] — are not.
For a permutation
p
of even length
n
you can make an array
b
of length
n
2
such that:
b
i
=max(
p
2i−1
,
p
2i
)
for
1≤i≤
n
2
For example, if
p
= [
2,4,3,1,5,6
], then:
b
1
=max(
p
1
,
p
2
)=max(2,4)=4
b
2
=max(
p
3
,
p
4
)=max(3,1)=3
b
3
=max(
p
5
,
p
6
)=max(5,6)=6
As a result, we made
b
=
[4,3,6]
.
For a given array
b
, find the lexicographically minimal permutation
p
such that you can make the given array
b
from it.
If
b
= [
4,3,6
], then the lexicographically minimal permutation from which it can be made is
p
= [
1,4,2,3,5,6
], since:
b
1
=max(
p
1
,
p
2
)=max(1,4)=4
b
2
=max(
p
3
,
p
4
)=max(2,3)=3
b
3
=max(
p
5
,
p
6
)=max(5,6)=6
A permutation
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
is lexicographically smaller than a permutation
y
1
,
y
2
…,
y
n
if and only if there exists such
i
(
1≤i≤n
) that
x
1
=
y
1
,
x
2
=
y
2
,…,
x
i−1
=
y
i−1
and
x
i
<
y
i
.
Input
The first line of input data contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one even integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains exactly
n
2
integers
b
i
(
1≤
b
i
≤n
) — elements of array
b
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
values over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print on a separate line:
lexicographically minimal permutation
p
such that you can make an array
b
from it;
or a number -1 if the permutation you are looking for does not exist.
