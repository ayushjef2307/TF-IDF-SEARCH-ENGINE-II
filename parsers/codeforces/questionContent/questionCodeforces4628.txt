Fafa has an array A of n positive integers, the function f(A) is defined as . He wants to do q queries of two types:
1 l r x — find the maximum possible value of f(A), if x is to be added to one element in the range [l,  r]. You can choose to which element to add x.
2 l r x — increase all the elements in the range [l,  r] by value x.
Note that queries of type 1 don't affect the array elements.
Input
The first line contains one integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the length of the array.
The second line contains n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 < ai ≤ 109) — the array elements.
The third line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of queries.
Then q lines follow, line i describes the i-th query and contains four integers ti li ri xi .
It is guaranteed that at least one of the queries is of type 1.
Output
For each query of type 1, print the answer to the query.
