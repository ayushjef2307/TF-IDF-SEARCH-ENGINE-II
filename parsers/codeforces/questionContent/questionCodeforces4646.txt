Let us define two functions f and g on positive integer numbers.
You need to process Q queries. In each query, you will be given three integers l, r and k. You need to print the number of integers x between l and r inclusive, such that g(x) = k.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 2 × 105) representing the number of queries.
Q lines follow, each of which contains 3 integers l, r and k (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 106, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).
Output
For each query, print a single line containing the answer for that query.

Note
In the first example:
g(33) = 9 as g(33) = g(3 × 3) = g(9) = 9
g(47) = g(48) = g(60) = g(61) = 6
There are no such integers between 47 and 55.
g(4) = g(14) = g(22) = g(27) = g(39) = g(40) = g(41) = g(58) = 4
