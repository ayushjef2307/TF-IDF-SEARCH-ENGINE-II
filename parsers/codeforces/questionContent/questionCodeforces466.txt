You are given an integer
n
. Find a sequence of
n
distinct integers
a

,…,
a
n
such that
1≤

It can be proven that there exists a sequence of distinct integers that satisfies all the conditions above.
Input
The first line of input contains
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤3⋅
10
5
) — the length of the sequence you have to find.
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
3⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output
n
space-separated distinct integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
satisfying the conditions in the statement.
If there are several possible answers, you can output any of them. Please remember that your integers must be distinct!
