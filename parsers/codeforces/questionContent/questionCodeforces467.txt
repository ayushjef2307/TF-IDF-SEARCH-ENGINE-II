Given two integers
n
and
x
, a permutation
†
†
p
of length
n
is called funny if
p
i
is a multiple of
i
for all
1≤i≤n−1
,
p
n
=1
, and
p
1
=x
.
Find the lexicographically minimal
‡
‡
funny permutation, or report that no such permutation exists.
†
†
A permutation of length
n
is an array consisting of each of the integers from
1
to
n
exactly once.
‡
‡
Let
a
and
b
be permutations of length
n
. Then
a
is lexicographically smaller than
b
if in the first position
i
where
a
and
b
differ,
a
i
<
b
i
. A permutation is lexicographically minimal if it is lexicographically smaller than all other permutations.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
x
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;
1<x≤n
).
The sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, if the answer exists, output
n
distinct integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — the lexicographically minimal funny permutation
p
. Otherwise, output
−1
.

Note
In the first test case, the permutation
[3,2,1]
satisfies all the conditions:
p
1
=3
,
p
3
=1
, and:
p
1
=3
is a multiple of
1
.
p
2
=2
is a multiple of
2
.
In the second test case, the permutation
[2,4,3,1]
satisfies all the conditions:
p
1
=2
,
p
4
=1
, and:
p
1
=2
is a multiple of
1
.
p
2
=4
is a multiple of
2
.
p
3
=3
is a multiple of
3
.
We can show that these permutations are lexicographically minimal.
No such permutations exist in the third test case.
