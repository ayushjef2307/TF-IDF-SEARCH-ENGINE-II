Vova has recently learned what a circulaton in a graph is. Recall the definition: let
G=(V,E)
be a directed graph. A circulation
f
is such a collection of non-negative real numbers
f
e
(
e∈E
), that for each vertex
v∈V
the following conservation condition holds:
∑
e∈
δ
−
(v)
f
e
=
∑
e∈
δ
+
(v)
f
e
∑
f
∑
f
where
δ
+
(v)
is the set of edges that end in the vertex
v
, and
δ
−
(v)
is the set of edges that start in the vertex
v
. In other words, for each vertex the total incoming flow should be equal to the total outcoming flow.
Let a
lr
-circulation be such a circulation
f
that for each edge the condition
l
e
≤
f
e
≤
r
e
holds, where
l
e
and
r
e
for each edge
e∈E
are two non-negative real numbers denoting the lower and upper bounds on the value of the circulation on this edge
e
.
Vova can't stop thinking about applications of a new topic. Right now he thinks about the following natural question: let the graph be fixed, and each value
l
e
and
r
e
be a linear function of a real variable
t
:
l
e
(t)=
a
e
t+
b
e
l
(
)
b
r
e
(t)=
c
e
t+
d
e
(
)
d
Note that
t
is the same for all edges.
Let
t
be chosen at random from uniform distribution on a segment
[0,1]
. What is the probability of existence of
lr
-circulation in the graph?
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
,
m
(
1≤n≤1000
,
1≤m≤2000
).
Each of the next
m
lines describes edges of the graph in the format
u
e
,
v
e

a
e

b

c

c
e

), where
u
e
and
v
e
are the startpoint and the endpoint of the edge
e
, and the remaining 4 integers describe the linear functions for the upper and lower bound of circulation.
It is guaranteed that for any
t∈[0,1]
and for any edge
e∈E
the following condition holds
0≤
l
e
(t)≤
r
e
(t)≤
10

.
Output
Print a single real integer — the probability of existence of
lr
-circulation in the graph, given that
t
is chosen uniformly at random from the segment
[0,1]
. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute difference from jury's answer is not greater than
10
−6
.

Note
In the first example the conservation condition allows only circulations with equal values
f
e
for all three edges. The value of circulation on the last edge should be

t
is chosen, so the probability is
