Vitya has learned that the answer for The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything is not the integer 54 42, but an increasing integer sequence
a
1
,…,
a
n
. In order to not reveal the secret earlier than needed, Vitya encrypted the answer and obtained the sequence
b
1
,…,
b
n
using the following rules:
b
1
=
a
1
;
b
i
=
a
i
⊕
a
i−1
for all
i
from 2 to
n
, where
x⊕y
is the bitwise XOR of
x
and
y
.
It is easy to see that the original sequence can be obtained using the rule
a
i
=
b
1
⊕…⊕
b
i
.
However, some time later Vitya discovered that the integers
b
i
in the cypher got shuffled, and it can happen that when decrypted using the rule mentioned above, it can produce a sequence that is not increasing. In order to save his reputation in the scientific community, Vasya decided to find some permutation of integers
b
i
so that the sequence
a
i
=
b
1
⊕…⊕
b
i
is strictly increasing. Help him find such a permutation or determine that it is impossible.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
b
1
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
<
2
60
).
Output
If there are no valid permutations, print a single line containing "No".
Otherwise in the first line print the word "Yes", and in the second line print integers
b
′
1
,…,
b
′
n
 — a valid permutation of integers
b
i
. The unordered multisets
{
b
1
,…,
b
n
}
and
{
b
′
1
,…,
b
′
n
}
should be equal, i. e. for each integer
x
the number of occurrences of
x
in the first multiset should be equal to the number of occurrences of
x
in the second multiset. Apart from this, the sequence
a
i
=
b
′
1
⊕…⊕
b
′
i
should be strictly increasing.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.
