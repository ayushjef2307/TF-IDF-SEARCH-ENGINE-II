A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward. For example, the strings
z
,
aaa
,
aba
, and
abccba
are palindromes, but
codeforces
and
ab
are not.
The double of a string
s
is obtained by writing each character twice. For example, the double of
seeing
is
sseeeeiinngg
.
Given a string
s
, rearrange its double to form a palindrome. Output the rearranged string. It can be proven that such a rearrangement always exists.
Input
The first line of input contains
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a single string
s
(
1≤|s|≤100
) consisting only of lowercase English letters.
Note that the sum of
|s|
over all test cases is not bounded.
Output
For each test case, output a palindromic string of length
2⋅|s|
that is a rearrangement of the double of
s
.
Example

output
Copy
aa

rgnororerrerorongr
aannuuttffoorraajjaarrooffttuunnaa
Note
In the first test case, the double of
a
is
aa
, which is already a palindrome.
In the second test case, the double of
sururu
is
ssuurruurruu
. If we move the first
s
to the end, we get
suurruurruus
, which is a palindrome.
In the third test case, the double of
errorgorn
is
eerrrroorrggoorrnn
. We can rearrange the characters to form
rgnororerrerorongr
, which is a palindrome.
