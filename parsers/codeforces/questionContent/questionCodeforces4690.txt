Alice likes snow a lot! Unfortunately, this year's winter is already over, and she can't expect to have any more of it. Bob has thus bought her a gift — a large snow maker. He plans to make some amount of snow every day. On day i he will make a pile of snow of volume Vi and put it in her garden.
Each day, every pile will shrink a little due to melting. More precisely, when the temperature on a given day is Ti, each pile will reduce its volume by Ti. If this would reduce the volume of a pile to or below zero, it disappears forever. All snow piles are independent of each other.
Note that the pile made on day i already loses part of its volume on the same day. In an extreme case, this may mean that there are no piles left at the end of a particular day.
You are given the initial pile sizes and the temperature on each day. Determine the total volume of snow melted on each day.
Input
The first line contains a single integer N (1 ≤ N ≤ 105) — the number of days.
The second line contains N integers V1, V2, ..., VN (0 ≤ Vi ≤ 109), where Vi is the initial size of a snow pile made on the day i.
The third line contains N integers T1, T2, ..., TN (0 ≤ Ti ≤ 109), where Ti is the temperature on the day i.
Output
Output a single line with N integers, where the i-th integer represents the total volume of snow melted on day i.

Note
In the first sample, Bob first makes a snow pile of volume 10, which melts to the size of 5 on the same day. On the second day, he makes another pile of size 10. Since it is a bit warmer than the day before, the first pile disappears completely while the second pile shrinks to 3. At the end of the second day, he has only a single pile of size 3. On the third day he makes a smaller pile than usual, but as the temperature dropped too, both piles survive till the end of the day.
