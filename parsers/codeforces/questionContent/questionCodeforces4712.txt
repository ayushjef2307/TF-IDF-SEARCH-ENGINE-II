Let D(x) be the number of positive divisors of a positive integer x. For example, D(2) = 2 (2 is divisible by 1 and 2), D(6) = 4 (6 is divisible by 1, 2, 3 and 6).
You are given an array a of n integers. You have to process two types of queries:
REPLACE l r — for every replace ai with D(ai);
SUM l r — calculate .
Print the answer for each SUM query.
Input
The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 3·105) — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries to process, respectively.
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 106) — the elements of the array.
Then m lines follow, each containing 3 integers ti, li, ri denoting i-th query. If ti = 1, then i-th query is REPLACE li ri, otherwise it's SUM li ri (1 ≤ ti ≤ 2, 1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n).
There is at least one SUM query.
Output
For each SUM query print the answer to it.
