You are given a graph with
n
nodes and
m
directed edges. One lowercase letter is assigned to each node. We define a path's value as the number of the most frequently occurring letter. For example, if letters on a path are "abaca", then the value of that path is
3
. Your task is find a path whose value is the largest.
Input
The first line contains two positive integers
n,m
(
1≤n,m≤300000
), denoting that the graph has
n
nodes and
m
directed edges.
The second line contains a string
s
with only lowercase English letters. The
i
-th character is the letter assigned to the
i
-th node.
Then
m
lines follow. Each line contains two integers
x,y
(
1≤x,y≤n
), describing a directed edge from
x
to
y
. Note that
x
can be equal to
y
and there can be multiple edges between
x
and
y
. Also the graph can be not connected.
Output
Output a single line with a single integer denoting the largest value. If the value can be arbitrarily large, output -1 instead.

Note
In the first sample, the path with largest value is
1→3→4→5
. The value is
3
because the letter 'a' appears
3
times.
