Given a string s, process q queries, each having one of the following forms:
1 i c — Change the i-th character in the string to c.
2 l r y — Consider the substring of s starting at position l and ending at position r. Output the number of times y occurs as a substring in it.
Input
The first line of the input contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 105) of lowercase English letters.
The second line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105)  — the number of queries to process.
The next q lines describe the queries and may have one of the following forms:
1 i c (1 ≤ i ≤ |s|)
2 l r y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ |s|)
c is a lowercase English letter and y is a non-empty string consisting of only lowercase English letters.
The sum of |y| over all queries of second type is at most 105.
It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of second type.
All strings are 1-indexed.
|s| is the length of the string s.
Output
For each query of type 2, output the required answer in a separate line.

Note
Consider the first sample case. Initially, the string aba occurs 3 times in the range [1, 7]. Note that two occurrences may overlap.
After the update, the string becomes ababcbaba and now aba occurs only once in the range [1, 7].
