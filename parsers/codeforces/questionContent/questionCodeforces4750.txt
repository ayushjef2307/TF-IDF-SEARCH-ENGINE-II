Given an array a1, a2, ..., an of n integers, find the largest number in the array that is not a perfect square.
A number x is said to be a perfect square if there exists an integer y such that x = y2.
Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of elements in the array.
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an ( - 106 ≤ ai ≤ 106) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that at least one element of the array is not a perfect square.
Output
Print the largest number in the array which is not a perfect square. It is guaranteed that an answer always exists.
