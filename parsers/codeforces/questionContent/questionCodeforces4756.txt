A New Year party is not a New Year party without lemonade! As usual, you are expecting a lot of guests, and buying lemonade has already become a pleasant necessity.
Your favorite store sells lemonade in bottles of n different volumes at different costs. A single bottle of type i has volume 2i - 1 liters and costs ci roubles. The number of bottles of each type in the store can be considered infinite.
You want to buy at least L liters of lemonade. How many roubles do you have to spend?
Input
The first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 109) — the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, respectively.
The second line contains n integers c1, c2, ..., cn (1 ≤ ci ≤ 109) — the costs of bottles of different types.
Output
Output a single integer — the smallest number of roubles you have to pay in order to buy at least L liters of lemonade.

Note
In the first example you should buy one 8-liter bottle for 90 roubles and two 2-liter bottles for 30 roubles each. In total you'll get 12 liters of lemonade for just 150 roubles.
In the second example, even though you need only 3 liters, it's cheaper to buy a single 8-liter bottle for 10 roubles.
In the third example it's best to buy three 1-liter bottles for 10 roubles each, getting three liters for 30 roubles.
