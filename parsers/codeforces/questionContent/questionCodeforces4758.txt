The following problem is well-known: given integers n and m, calculate
,
where 2n = 2·2·...·2 (n factors), and denotes the remainder of division of x by y.
You are asked to solve the "reverse" problem. Given integers n and m, calculate
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 108).
The second line contains a single integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 108).
Output
Output a single integer — the value of .
