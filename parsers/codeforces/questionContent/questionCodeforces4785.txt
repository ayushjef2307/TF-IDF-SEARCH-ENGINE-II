Carol is currently curling.
She has n disks each with radius r on the 2D plane.
Initially she has all these disks above the line y = 10100.
She then will slide the disks towards the line y = 0 one by one in order from 1 to n.
When she slides the i-th disk, she will place its center at the point (xi, 10100). She will then push it so the disk’s y coordinate continuously decreases, and x coordinate stays constant. The disk stops once it touches the line y = 0 or it touches any previous disk. Note that once a disk stops moving, it will not move again, even if hit by another disk.
Compute the y-coordinates of centers of all the disks after all disks have been pushed.
Input
The first line will contain two integers n and r (1 ≤ n, r ≤ 1 000), the number of disks, and the radius of the disks, respectively.
The next line will contain n integers x1, x2, ..., xn (1 ≤ xi ≤ 1 000) — the x-coordinates of the disks.
Output
Print a single line with n numbers. The i-th number denotes the y-coordinate of the center of the i-th disk. The output will be accepted if it has absolute or relative error at most 10 - 6.
Namely, let's assume that your answer for a particular value of a coordinate is a and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct if for all coordinates.

Note
The final positions of the disks will look as follows:
In particular, note the position of the last disk.
