We call an array
a
of length
n
fancy if for each
1<i≤n
it holds that
a
i
=
a
i−1
+1
.
Let's call
f(p)
applied to a permutation
†
†
of length
n
as the minimum number of subarrays it can be partitioned such that each one of them is fancy. For example
f([1,2,3])=1
, while
f([3,1,2])=2
and
f([3,2,1])=3
.
Given
n
and a permutation
p
of length
n
, we define a permutation
p
′
of length
n
to be
k
-special if and only if:
p
′
is lexicographically smaller
‡
‡
than
p
, and
f(
p
′
)=k
.
Your task is to count for each
1≤k≤n
the number of
k
-special permutations modulo
m
.

A permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
‡
‡
A permutation
a
of length
n
is lexicographically smaller than a permutation
b
of length
n
if and only if the following holds: in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the permutation
a
has a smaller element than the corresponding element in
b
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤2000
,
10≤m≤
10
9
) — the length of the permutation and the required modulo.
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — the permutation
p
.
Output
Print
n
integers, where the
k
-th integer is the number of
k
-special permutations modulo
m
.

Note
In the first example, the permutations that are lexicographically smaller than
[1,3,4,2]
are:
[1,2,3,4]
,
f([1,2,3,4])=1
;
[1,2,4,3]
,
f([1,2,4,3])=3
;
[1,3,2,4]
,
f([1,3,2,4])=4
.
Thus our answer is
[1,0,1,1]
.
In the second example, the permutations that are lexicographically smaller than
[3,2,1]
are:
[1,2,3]
,
f([1,2,3])=1
;
[1,3,2]
,
f([1,3,2])=3
;
[2,1,3]
,
f([2,1,3])=3
;
[2,3,1]
,
f([2,3,1])=2
;
[3,1,2]
,
f([3,1,2])=2
.
Thus our answer is
[1,2,2]
.
