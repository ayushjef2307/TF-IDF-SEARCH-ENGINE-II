You are given two integers
n
and
m
and an array
a
of
n
integers. For each
1≤i≤n
it holds that
1≤
a
i
≤m
.
Your task is to count the number of different arrays
b
of length
n
such that:
1≤
b
i
≤m
for each
1≤i≤n
, and
gcd(
b
1
,
b
2
,
b
3
,...,
b
i
)=
a
i
for each
1≤i≤n
.
Here
gcd(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
i
)
denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
i
.
Since this number can be too large, print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
Each test consist of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤m≤
10
9
) — the length of the array
a
and the maximum possible value of the element.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤m
) — the elements of the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
across all test cases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the number of different arrays satisfying the conditions above. Since this number can be large, print it modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case, the possible arrays
b
are:
[4,2,1]
;
[4,2,3]
;
[4,2,5]
.
In the second test case, the only array satisfying the demands is
[1,1]
.
In the third test case, it can be proven no such array exists.
