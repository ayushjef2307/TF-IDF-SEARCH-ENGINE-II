Hands that shed innocent blood!
There are n guilty people in a line, the i-th of them holds a claw with length Li. The bell rings and every person kills some of people in front of him. All people kill others at the same time. Namely, the i-th person kills the j-th person if and only if j < i and j ≥ i - Li.
You are given lengths of the claws. You need to find the total number of alive people after the bell rings.
Input
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of guilty people.
Second line contains n space-separated integers L1, L2, ..., Ln (0 ≤ Li ≤ 109), where Li is the length of the i-th person's claw.
Output
Print one integer — the total number of alive people after the bell rings.
