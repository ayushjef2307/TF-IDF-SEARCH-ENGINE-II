You are given an array a with n distinct integers. Construct an array b by permuting a such that for every non-empty subset of indices S = {x1, x2, ..., xk} (1 ≤ xi ≤ n, 0 < k < n) the sums of elements on that positions in a and b are different, i. e.
Input
The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 22) — the size of the array.
The second line contains n space-separated distinct integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of the array.
Output
If there is no such array b, print -1.
Otherwise in the only line print n space-separated integers b1, b2, ..., bn. Note that b must be a permutation of a.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note
An array x is a permutation of y, if we can shuffle elements of y such that it will coincide with x.
Note that the empty subset and the subset containing all indices are not counted.
