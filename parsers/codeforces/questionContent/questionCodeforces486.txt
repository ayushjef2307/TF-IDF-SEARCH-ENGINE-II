You are given a permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of size
n
, where each integer from
1
to
n
appears exactly once.
You can do the following operation any number of times (possibly, zero):
Choose any three indices
i,j,k
(
1≤i<j<k≤n
).
If
a
i
>
a
k
, replace
a
i
with
a
i
+
a
j
. Otherwise, swap
a
j
and
a
k
.
Determine whether you can make the array
a
sorted in non-descending order.
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤5000
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤10
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
,
a
i
≠
a
j
if
i≠j
) — the elements of the array
a
.
Output
For each test case, output "Yes" (without quotes) if the array can be sorted in non-descending order, and "No" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, strings "YES", "yEs" and "yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
In the first test case,
[1,2,3]
is already sorted in non-descending order.
In the second test case, we can choose
i=1,j=2,k=3
. Since
a
1
≤
a
3
, swap
a
2
and
a
3
, the array then becomes
[1,2,3]
, which is sorted in non-descending order.
In the seventh test case, we can do the following operations successively:
Choose
i=5,j=6,k=7
. Since
a
5
≤
a
7
, swap
a
6
and
a
7
, the array then becomes
[1,2,6,7,4,5,3]
.
Choose
i=5,j=6,k=7
. Since
a
5
>
a
7
, replace
a
5
with
a
5
+
a
6
=9
, the array then becomes
[1,2,6,7,9,5,3]
.
Choose
i=2,j=5,k=7
. Since
a
2
≤
a
7
, swap
a
5
and
a
7
, the array then becomes
[1,2,6,7,3,5,9]
.
Choose
i=2,j=4,k=6
. Since
a
2
≤
a
6
, swap
a
4
and
a
6
, the array then becomes
[1,2,6,5,3,7,9]
.
Choose
i=1,j=3,k=5
. Since
a
1
≤
a
5
, swap
a
3
and
a
5
, the array then becomes
[1,2,3,5,6,7,9]
, which is sorted in non-descending order.
In the third, the fourth, the fifth and the sixth test cases, it can be shown that the array cannot be sorted in non-descending order.
