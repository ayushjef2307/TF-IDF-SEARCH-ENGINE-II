Consider an array
a
of length
n
with elements numbered from
1
to
n
. It is possible to remove the
i
-th element of
a
if
gcd(
a
i
,i)=1
, where
gcd
denotes the greatest common divisor. After an element is removed, the elements to the right are shifted to the left by one position.
An array
b
with
n
integers such that
1≤
b
i
≤n−i+1
is a removal sequence for the array
a
if it is possible to remove all elements of
a
, if you remove the
b
1
-th element, then the
b
2
-th, ..., then the
b
n
-th element. For example, let
a=[42,314]
:
[1,1]
is a removal sequence: when you remove the
1
-st element of the array, the condition
gcd(42,1)=1
holds, and the array becomes
[314]
; when you remove the
1
-st element again, the condition
gcd(314,1)=1
holds, and the array becomes empty.
[2,1]
is not a removal sequence: when you try to remove the
2
-nd element, the condition
gcd(314,2)=1
is false.
An array is ambiguous if it has at least two removal sequences. For example, the array
[1,2,5]
is ambiguous: it has removal sequences
[3,1,1]
and
[1,2,1]
. The array
[42,314]
is not ambiguous: the only removal sequence it has is
[1,1]
.
You are given two integers
n
and
m
. You have to calculate the number of ambiguous arrays
a
such that the length of
a
is from
1
to
n
and each
a
i
is an integer from
1
to
m
.
Input
The only line of the input contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤3⋅
10
5
;
1≤m≤
10
12
).
Output
Print one integer — the number of ambiguous arrays
a
such that the length of
a
is from
1
to
n
and each
a
i
is an integer from
1
to
m
. Since the answer can be very large, print it modulo
998244353
.
