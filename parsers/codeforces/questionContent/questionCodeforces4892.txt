There are n military men in the Berland army. Some of them have given orders to other military men by now. Given m pairs (xi, yi), meaning that the military man xi gave the i-th order to another military man yi.
It is time for reform! The Berland Ministry of Defence plans to introduce ranks in the Berland army. Each military man should be assigned a rank — integer number between 1 and k, inclusive. Some of them have been already assigned a rank, but the rest of them should get a rank soon.
Help the ministry to assign ranks to the rest of the army so that:
for each of m orders it is true that the rank of a person giving the order (military man xi) is strictly greater than the rank of a person receiving the order (military man yi);
for each rank from 1 to k there is at least one military man with this rank.
Input
The first line contains three integers n, m and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·105, 0 ≤ m ≤ 2·105, 1 ≤ k ≤ 2·105) — number of military men in the Berland army, number of orders and number of ranks.
The second line contains n integers r1, r2, ..., rn, where ri > 0 (in this case 1 ≤ ri ≤ k) means that the i-th military man has been already assigned the rank ri; ri = 0 means the i-th military man doesn't have a rank yet.
The following m lines contain orders one per line. Each order is described with a line containing two integers xi, yi (1 ≤ xi, yi ≤ n, xi ≠ yi). This line means that the i-th order was given by the military man xi to the military man yi. For each pair (x, y) of military men there could be several orders from x to y.
Output
Print n integers, where the i-th number is the rank of the i-th military man. If there are many solutions, print any of them.
If there is no solution, print the only number -1.
