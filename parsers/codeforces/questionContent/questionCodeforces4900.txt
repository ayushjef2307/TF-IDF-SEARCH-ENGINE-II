Petya learned a new programming language CALPAS. A program in this language always takes one non-negative integer and returns one non-negative integer as well.
In the language, there are only three commands: apply a bitwise operation AND, OR or XOR with a given constant to the current integer. A program can contain an arbitrary sequence of these operations with arbitrary constants from 0 to 1023. When the program is run, all operations are applied (in the given order) to the argument and in the end the result integer is returned.
Petya wrote a program in this language, but it turned out to be too long. Write a program in CALPAS that does the same thing as the Petya's program, and consists of no more than 5 lines. Your program should return the same integer as Petya's program for all arguments from 0 to 1023.
Input
The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·105) — the number of lines.
Next n lines contain commands. A command consists of a character that represents the operation ("&", "|" or "^" for AND, OR or XOR respectively), and the constant xi 0 ≤ xi ≤ 1023.
Output
Output an integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 5) — the length of your program.
Next k lines must contain commands in the same format as in the input.

Second sample:
Let x be an input of the Petya's program. It's output is ((x&1)&3)&5 = x&(1&3&5) = x&1. So these two programs always give the same outputs.
