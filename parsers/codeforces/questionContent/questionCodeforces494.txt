The position of the leftmost maximum on the segment
[l;r]
of array
x=[
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
n
]
is the smallest integer
i
such that
l≤i≤r
and
x
i
=max(
x
l
,
x
l+1
,…,
x
r
)
.
You are given an array
a=[
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
]
of length
n
. Find the number of integer arrays
b=[
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
]
of length
n
that satisfy the following conditions:
1≤
b
i
≤m
for all
1≤i≤n
;
for all pairs of integers
1≤l≤r≤n
, the position of the leftmost maximum on the segment
[l;r]
of the array
b
is equal to the position of the leftmost maximum on the segment
[l;r]
of the array
a
.
Since the answer might be very large, print its remainder modulo
10

+7
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
3
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n,m≤2⋅
10
5
,
n⋅m≤
10
6
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤m
) — the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n⋅m
over all test cases doesn't exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each test case print one integer — the number of arrays
b
that satisfy the conditions from the statement, modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
In the first test case, the following
8
arrays satisfy the conditions from the statement:
[1,2,1]
;
[1,2,2]
;
[1,3,1]
;
[1,3,2]
;
[1,3,3]
;
[2,3,1]

5
arrays satisfy the conditions from the statement:
[1,1,1,1]
;
[2,1,1,1]
;
[2,2,1,1]
;
[2,2,2,1]
