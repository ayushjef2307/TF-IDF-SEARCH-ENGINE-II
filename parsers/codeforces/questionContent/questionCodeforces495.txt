You are given three integers
a
,
b
, and
d
. Your task is to find any integer
x
which satisfies all of the following conditions, or determine that no such integers exist:
0≤x<
2
60
;
a|x
is divisible by
d
;
b|x
is divisible by
d
.
Here,
|
denotes the bitwise OR operation.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line, containing three integers
a
,
b
, and
d
(
1≤a,b,d<
2
30
).
Output
For each test case print one integer. If there exists an integer
x
which satisfies all of the conditions from the statement, print
x
. Otherwise, print
−1
.
If there are multiple solutions, you may print any of them.

Note
In the first test case,
x=18
is one of the possible solutions, since
39|18=55
and
12|18=30
, both of which are multiples of
d=5
.
In the second test case,
x=14
is one of the possible solutions, since
8|14=6|14=14
, which is a multiple of
d=14
.
In the third and fourth test cases, we can show that there are no solutions.
