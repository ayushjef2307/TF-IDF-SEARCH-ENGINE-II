Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:
letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;
there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a1 < j < a2 for some a1 and a2 from A).
Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.
Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.
The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
Output
Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.

Note
In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.
In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.
In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
