Let quasi-palindromic number be such number that adding some leading zeros (possible none) to it produces a palindromic string.
String t is called a palindrome, if it reads the same from left to right and from right to left.
For example, numbers 131 and 2010200 are quasi-palindromic, they can be transformed to strings "131" and "002010200", respectively, which are palindromes.
You are given some integer number x. Check if it's a quasi-palindromic number.
Input
The first line contains one integer number x (1 ≤ x ≤ 109). This number is given without any leading zeroes.
Output
Print "YES" if number x is quasi-palindromic. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).
