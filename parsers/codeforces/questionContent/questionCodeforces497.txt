A non-empty digit string is diverse if the number of occurrences of each character in it doesn't exceed the number of distinct characters in it.
For example:
string "7" is diverse because 7 appears in it
1
time and the number of distinct characters in it is
1
;
string "77" is not diverse because 7 appears in it
2
times and the number of distinct characters in it is
1
;
string "1010" is diverse because both 0 and 1 appear in it
2
times and the number of distinct characters in it is
2
;
string "6668" is not diverse because 6 appears in it
3
times and the number of distinct characters in it is
2
.
You are given a string
s
of length
n
, consisting of only digits
0
to
9
. Find how many of its
n(n+1)
2
substrings are diverse.
A string
a
is a substring of a string
b
if
a
can be obtained from
b
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
Note that if the same diverse string appears in
s
multiple times, each occurrence should be counted independently. For example, there are two diverse substrings in "77" both equal to "7", so the answer for the string "77" is
2
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the string
s
.
The second line of each test case contains a string
s
of length
n
. It is guaranteed that all characters of
s
are digits from
0
to
9
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print one integer — the number of diverse substrings of the given string
s
.

Note
In the first test case, the diverse substring is "7".
In the second test case, the only diverse substring is "7", which appears twice, so the answer is
2
.
In the third test case, the diverse substrings are "0" (
2
times), "01", "010", "1" (
2
times), "10" (
2
times), "101" and "1010".
In the fourth test case, the diverse substrings are "0" (
3
times), "01", "011", "0110", "1" (
2
times), "10", "100", "110" and "1100".
In the fifth test case, the diverse substrings are "3", "39", "399", "6", "9" (
4
times), "96" and "996".
In the sixth test case, all
15
non-empty substrings of "23456" are diverse.
