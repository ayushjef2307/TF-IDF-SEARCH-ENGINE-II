For given integers
n
and
m
, let's call a pair of arrays
a
and
b
of integers good, if they satisfy the following conditions:
a
and
b
have the same length, let their length be
k
.
k≥2
and
a
1
=0,
a
k
=n,
b
1
=0,
b
k
=m
.
For each
1<i≤k
the following holds:
a
i
≥
a
i−1
,
b
i
≥
b
i−1
, and
a
i
+
b
i
≠
a
i−1
+
b
i−1
.
Find the sum of
|a|
over all good pairs of arrays
(a,b)
. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t(1≤t≤
10
4
)
 — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(1≤n,m≤5⋅
10
6
)
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅
10
6
and the sum of
m
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅
10
6
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer  — the sum of
|a|
over all good pairs of arrays
(a,b)
modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
In the first testcase, the good pairs of arrays are
([0,1],[0,1])
, length =
2
.
([0,1,1],[0,0,1])
, length =
3
.
([0,0,1],[0,1,1])
, length =
3
.
Hence the sum of the lengths would be
2+3+3=8
.
