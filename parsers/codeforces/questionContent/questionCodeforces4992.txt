Professor Dumbledore is helping Harry destroy the Horcruxes. He went to Gaunt Shack as he suspected a Horcrux to be present there. He saw Marvolo Gaunt's Ring and identified it as a Horcrux. Although he destroyed it, he is still affected by its curse. Professor Snape is helping Dumbledore remove the curse. For this, he wants to give Dumbledore exactly x drops of the potion he made.
Value of x is calculated as maximum of p·ai + q·aj + r·ak for given p, q, r and array a1, a2, ... an such that 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n. Help Snape find the value of x. Do note that the value of x may be negative.
Input
First line of input contains 4 integers n, p, q, r ( - 109 ≤ p, q, r ≤ 109, 1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
Next line of input contains n space separated integers a1, a2, ... an ( - 109 ≤ ai ≤ 109).
Output
Output a single integer the maximum value of p·ai + q·aj + r·ak that can be obtained provided 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n.

Note
In the first sample case, we can take i = j = k = 5, thus making the answer as 1·5 + 2·5 + 3·5 = 30.
In second sample case, selecting i = j = 1 and k = 5 gives the answer 12.
