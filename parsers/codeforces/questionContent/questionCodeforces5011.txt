Arpa is researching the Mexican wave.
There are n spectators in the stadium, labeled from 1 to n. They start the Mexican wave at time 0.
At time 1, the first spectator stands.
At time 2, the second spectator stands.
...
At time k, the k-th spectator stands.
At time k + 1, the (k + 1)-th spectator stands and the first spectator sits.
At time k + 2, the (k + 2)-th spectator stands and the second spectator sits.
...
At time n, the n-th spectator stands and the (n - k)-th spectator sits.
At time n + 1, the (n + 1 - k)-th spectator sits.
...
At time n + k, the n-th spectator sits.
Arpa wants to know how many spectators are standing at time t.
Input
The first line contains three integers n, k, t (1 ≤ n ≤ 109, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, 1 ≤ t < n + k).
Output
Print single integer: how many spectators are standing at time t.

Note
In the following a sitting spectator is represented as -, a standing spectator is represented as ^.
At t = 0  ---------- number of standing spectators = 0.
At t = 1  ^--------- number of standing spectators = 1.
At t = 2  ^^-------- number of standing spectators = 2.
At t = 3  ^^^------- number of standing spectators = 3.
At t = 4  ^^^^------ number of standing spectators = 4.
At t = 5  ^^^^^----- number of standing spectators = 5.
At t = 6  -^^^^^---- number of standing spectators = 5.
At t = 7  --^^^^^--- number of standing spectators = 5.
At t = 8  ---^^^^^-- number of standing spectators = 5.
At t = 9  ----^^^^^- number of standing spectators = 5.
At t = 10 -----^^^^^ number of standing spectators = 5.
At t = 11 ------^^^^ number of standing spectators = 4.
At t = 12 -------^^^ number of standing spectators = 3.
At t = 13 --------^^ number of standing spectators = 2.
At t = 14 ---------^ number of standing spectators = 1.
At t = 15 ---------- number of standing spectators = 0.
