Mojtaba and Arpa are playing a game. They have a list of n numbers in the game.
In a player's turn, he chooses a number pk (where p is a prime number and k is a positive integer) such that pk divides at least one number in the list. For each number in the list divisible by pk, call it x, the player will delete x and add to the list. The player who can not make a valid choice of p and k loses.
Mojtaba starts the game and the players alternatively make moves. Determine which one of players will be the winner if both players play optimally.
Input
The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in the list.
The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109) — the elements of the list.
Output
If Mojtaba wins, print "Mojtaba", otherwise print "Arpa" (without quotes).
You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note
In the first sample test, Mojtaba can't move.
In the second sample test, Mojtaba chooses p = 17 and k = 1, then the list changes to [1, 1, 1, 1].
In the third sample test, if Mojtaba chooses p = 17 and k = 1, then Arpa chooses p = 17 and k = 1 and wins, if Mojtaba chooses p = 17 and k = 2, then Arpa chooses p = 17 and k = 1 and wins.
