You are given an integer
n
.
Let's define
s(n)
as the string "BAN" concatenated
n
times. For example,
s(1)
= "BAN",
s(3)
= "BANBANBAN". Note that the length of the string
s(n)
is equal to
3n
.
Consider
s(n)
. You can perform the following operation on
s(n)
any number of times (possibly zero):
Select any two distinct indices
i
and
j
(1≤i,j≤3n,i≠j)
.
Then, swap
s(n
)
i
and
s(n
)
j
.
You want the string "BAN" to not appear in
s(n)
as a subsequence. What's the smallest number of operations you have to do to achieve this? Also, find one such shortest sequence of operations.
A string
a
is a subsequence of a string
b
if
a
can be obtained from
b
by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤100)
 — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(1≤n≤100)
.
Output
For each test case, in the first line output
m
(
0≤m≤
10
5
) — the minimum number of operations required. It's guaranteed that the objective is always achievable in at most
10
5
operations under the constraints of the problem.
Then, output
m
lines. The
k
-th of these lines should contain two integers
i
k
,
j
k
(1≤
i
k
,
j
k
≤3n,
i
k
≠
j
k
)
denoting that you want to swap characters at indices
i
k
and
j
k
at the
k
-th operation.
After all
m
operations, "BAN" must not appear in
s(n)
as a subsequence.
If there are multiple possible answers, output any.

Note
In the first testcase,
s(1)=
"BAN", we can swap
s(1
)
1
and
s(1
)
2
, converting
s(1)
to "ABN", which does not contain "BAN" as a subsequence.
In the second testcase,
s(2)=
"BANBAN", we can swap
s(2
)
2
and
s(2
)
6
, converting
s(2)
to "BNNBAA", which does not contain "BAN" as a subsequence.
