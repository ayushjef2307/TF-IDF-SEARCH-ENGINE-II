You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers. You want to distribute these
n
integers into two groups
s
1
and
s
2
(groups can be empty) so that the following conditions are satisfied:
For each
i
(1≤i≤n)
,
a
i
goes into exactly one group.
The value
|sum(
s
1
)|−|sum(
s
2
)|
is the maximum possible among all such ways to distribute the integers.
Here
sum(
s
1
)
denotes the sum of the numbers in the group
s
1
, and
sum(
s
2
)
denotes the sum of the numbers in the group
s
2
.
Determine the maximum possible value of
|sum(
s
1
)|−|sum(
s
2
)|
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
)
 — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(1≤n≤
10
5
)
 — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
…
a
n
(−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
)
 — elements of the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer  — the maximum possible value of
|sum(
s
1
)|−|sum(
s
2
)|
.

Note
In the first testcase, we can distribute as
s
1
={10}
,
s
2
={−10}
. Then the value will be
|10|−|−10|=0
.
In the second testcase, we can distribute as
s
1
={0,11,−1}
,
s
2
={−2}
. Then the value will be
|0+11−1|−|−2|=10−2=8
.
In the third testcase, we can distribute as
s
1
={2,3,2}
,
s
2
={}
. Then the value will be
|2+3+2|−|0|=7
.
In the fourth testcase, we can distribute as
s
1
={−9,−4,0}
,
s
2
={2,0}
. Then the value will be
|−9−4+0|−|2+0|=13−2=11
.
