You have an array
a
consisting of
n
positive integers and you have to handle
q
queries of the following types:
1
i
x
: change
a
i
to
x
,
2
l
r
k
: check if the number of occurrences of every positive integer in the subarray
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…
a
r
is a multiple of
k
(check the example for better understanding).
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤3⋅
10
5
), the length of
a
and the number of queries.
Next line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the elements of
a
.
Each of the next
q
lines describes a query. It has one of the following forms.
1
i
x
, (
1≤i≤n
,
1≤x≤
10
9
), or
2
l
r
k
, (
1≤l≤r≤n
,
1≤k≤n
).
Output
For each query of the second type, if answer of the query is yes, print "YES", otherwise print "NO".

output
Copy
NO
YES
NO
YES
YES
Note
In the first query, requested subarray is
[1234,2,3,3,2,1]
, and it's obvious that the number of occurrence of
1
isn't divisible by
k=2
. So the answer is "NO".
In the third query, requested subarray is
[1,2,3,3,2,1]
, and it can be seen that the number of occurrence of every integer in this sub array is divisible by
k=2
. So the answer is "YES".
In the sixth query, requested subarray is
[1,2,3,3,2,1,1,2,3]
, and it can be seen that the number of occurrence of every integer in this sub array is divisible by
k=3
. So the answer is "YES".
