Kirill plays a new computer game. He came to the potion store where he can buy any potion. Each potion is characterized by two integers — amount of experience and cost. The efficiency of a potion is the ratio of the amount of experience to the cost. Efficiency may be a non-integer number.
For each two integer numbers a and b such that l ≤ a ≤ r and x ≤ b ≤ y there is a potion with experience a and cost b in the store (that is, there are (r - l + 1)·(y - x + 1) potions).
Kirill wants to buy a potion which has efficiency k. Will he be able to do this?
Input
First string contains five integer numbers l, r, x, y, k (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 107, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 107, 1 ≤ k ≤ 107).
Output
Print "YES" without quotes if a potion with efficiency exactly k can be bought in the store and "NO" without quotes otherwise.
You can output each of the letters in any register.
