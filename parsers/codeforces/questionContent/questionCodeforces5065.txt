Lech got into a tree consisting of n vertices with a root in vertex number 1. At each vertex i written integer ai. He will not get out until he answers q queries of the form u v. Answer for the query is maximal value among all vertices i on path from u to v including u and v, where dist(i, v) is number of edges on path from i to v. Also guaranteed that vertex u is ancestor of vertex v. Leha's tastes are very singular: he believes that vertex is ancestor of itself.
Help Leha to get out.
The expression means the bitwise exclusive OR to the numbers x and y.
Note that vertex u is ancestor of vertex v if vertex u lies on the path from root to the vertex v.
Input
First line of input data contains two integers n and q (1 ≤ n ≤ 5·104, 1 ≤ q ≤ 150 000) — number of vertices in the tree and number of queries respectively.
Next line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ n) — numbers on vertices.
Each of next n - 1 lines contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) — description of the edges in tree.
Guaranteed that given graph is a tree.
Each of next q lines contains two integers u and v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n) — description of queries. Guaranteed that vertex u is ancestor of vertex v.
Output
Output q lines — answers for a queries.
