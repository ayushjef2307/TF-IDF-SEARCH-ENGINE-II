Let's call the roundness of the number the number of zeros to which it ends.
You have an array of n numbers. You need to choose a subset of exactly k numbers so that the roundness of the product of the selected numbers will be maximum possible.
Input
The first line contains two integer numbers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 200, 1 ≤ k ≤ n).
The second line contains n space-separated integer numbers a1, a2, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 1018).
Output
Print maximal roundness of product of the chosen subset of length k.

Note
In the first example there are 3 subsets of 2 numbers. [50, 4] has product 200 with roundness 2, [4, 20] — product 80, roundness 1, [50, 20] — product 1000, roundness 3.
In the second example subset [15, 16, 25] has product 6000, roundness 3.
In the third example all subsets has product with roundness 0.
