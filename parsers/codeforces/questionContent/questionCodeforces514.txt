This is an easy version of the problem. The only difference between an easy and a hard version is the constraints on
a
,
b
,
c
and
d
.
You are given
4
positive integers
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
with
a<c
and
b<d
. Find any pair of numbers
x
and
y
that satisfies the following conditions:
a<x≤c
,
b<y≤d
,
x⋅y
is divisible by
a⋅b
.
Note that required
x
and
y
may not exist.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤10
), the number of test cases.
The descriptions of the test cases follow.
The only line of each test case contains four integers
a
,
b
,
c
and
d
(
1≤a<c≤
10
5
,
1≤b<d≤
10
5
).
Output
For each test case print a pair of numbers
a<x≤c
and
b<y≤d
such that
x⋅y
is divisible by
a⋅b
. If there are multiple answers, print any of them. If there is no such pair of numbers, then print -1 -1.
