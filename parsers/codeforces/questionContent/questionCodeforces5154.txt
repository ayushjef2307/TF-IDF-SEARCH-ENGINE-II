You are given a set of integer numbers, initially it is empty. You should perform n queries.
There are three different types of queries:
1 l r — Add all missing numbers from the interval [l, r]
2 l r — Remove all present numbers from the interval [l, r]
3 l r — Invert the interval [l, r] — add all missing and remove all present numbers from the interval [l, r]
After each query you should output MEX of the set — the smallest positive (MEX  ≥ 1) integer number which is not presented in the set.
Input
The first line contains one integer number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).
Next n lines contain three integer numbers t, l, r (1 ≤ t ≤ 3, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 1018) — type of the query, left and right bounds.
Output
Print MEX of the set after each query.

Note
Here are contents of the set after each query in the first example:
{3, 4} — the interval [3, 4] is added
{1, 2, 5, 6} — numbers {3, 4} from the interval [1, 6] got deleted and all the others are added
{5, 6} — numbers {1, 2} got deleted
