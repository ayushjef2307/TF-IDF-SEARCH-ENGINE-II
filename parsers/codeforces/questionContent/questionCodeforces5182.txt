In his spare time Vladik estimates beauty of the flags.
Every flag could be represented as the matrix n × m which consists of positive integers.
Let's define the beauty of the flag as number of components in its matrix. We call component a set of cells with same numbers and between any pair of cells from that set there exists a path through adjacent cells from same component. Here is the example of the partitioning some flag matrix into components:
But this time he decided to change something in the process. Now he wants to estimate not the entire flag, but some segment. Segment of flag can be described as a submatrix of the flag matrix with opposite corners at (1, l) and (n, r), where conditions 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ m are satisfied.
Help Vladik to calculate the beauty for some segments of the given flag.
Input
First line contains three space-separated integers n, m, q (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 1 ≤ m, q ≤ 105) — dimensions of flag matrix and number of segments respectively.
Each of next n lines contains m space-separated integers — description of flag matrix. All elements of flag matrix is positive integers not exceeding 106.
Each of next q lines contains two space-separated integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ m) — borders of segment which beauty Vladik wants to know.
Output
For each segment print the result on the corresponding line.
