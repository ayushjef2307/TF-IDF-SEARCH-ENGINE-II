Alice and Bob are playing a game on a graph. They have an undirected graph without self-loops and multiple edges. All vertices of the graph have degree equal to
2
. The graph may consist of several components. Note that if such graph has
n
vertices, it will have exactly
n
edges.
Alice and Bob take turn. Alice goes first. In each turn, the player can choose
k
(
l≤k≤r
;
l<r
) vertices that form a connected subgraph and erase these vertices from the graph, including all incident edges.
The player who can't make a step loses.
For example, suppose they are playing on the given graph with given
l=2
and
r=3
:
A valid vertex set for Alice to choose at the first move is one of the following:
{1,2}
{1,3}
{2,3}
{4,5}
{4,6}
{5,6}
{1,2,3}
{4,5,6}
Suppose, Alice chooses subgraph
{4,6}
.
Then a valid vertex set for Bob to choose at the first move is one of the following:
{1,2}
{1,3}
{2,3}
{1,2,3}
Suppose, Bob chooses subgraph
{1,2,3}
.
Alice can't make a move, so she loses.
You are given a graph of size
n
and integers
l
and
r
. Who will win if both Alice and Bob play optimally.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
l
and
r
(
3≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;
1≤l<r≤n
) — the number of vertices in the graph, and the constraints on the number of vertices Alice or Bob can choose in one move.
Next
n
lines contains edges of the graph: one edge per line. The
i
-th line contains two integers
u
i
and
v
i
(
1≤
u
i
,
v
i
≤n
;
u
i
≠
v
i
) — description of the
i
-th edge.
It's guaranteed that the degree of each vertex of the given graph is equal to
2
.
Output
Print Alice (case-insensitive) if Alice wins, or Bob otherwise.
