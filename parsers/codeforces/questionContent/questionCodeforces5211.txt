You are given an array a consisting of positive integers and q queries to this array. There are two types of queries:
1 l r x — for each index i such that l ≤ i ≤ r set ai = x.
2 l r — find the minimum among such ai that l ≤ i ≤ r.
We decided that this problem is too easy. So the array a is given in a compressed form: there is an array b consisting of n elements and a number k in the input, and before all queries a is equal to the concatenation of k arrays b (so the size of a is n·k).
Input
The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 105, 1 ≤ k ≤ 104).
The second line contains n integers — elements of the array b (1 ≤ bi ≤ 109).
The third line contains one integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105).
Then q lines follow, each representing a query. Each query is given either as 1 l r x — set all elements in the segment from l till r (including borders) to x (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n·k, 1 ≤ x ≤ 109) or as 2 l r — find the minimum among all elements in the segment from l till r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n·k).
Output
For each query of type 2 print the answer to this query — the minimum on the corresponding segment.
