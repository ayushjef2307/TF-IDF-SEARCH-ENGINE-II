The marmots have prepared a very easy problem for this year's HC2 – this one. It involves numbers n, k and a sequence of n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an. They also came up with a beautiful and riveting story for the problem statement. It explains what the input means, what the program should output, and it also reads like a good criminal.
However I, Heidi, will have none of that. As my joke for today, I am removing the story from the statement and replacing it with these two unhelpful paragraphs. Now solve the problem, fools!
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 2200). The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, ..., an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 104).
Output
Output one number.
