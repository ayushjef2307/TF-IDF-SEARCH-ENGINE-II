Now that you have proposed a fake post for the HC2 Facebook page, Heidi wants to measure the quality of the post before actually posting it. She recently came across a (possibly fake) article about the impact of fractal structure on multimedia messages and she is now trying to measure the self-similarity of the message, which is defined as
where the sum is over all nonempty strings p and is the number of occurences of p in s as a substring. (Note that the sum is infinite, but it only has a finite number of nonzero summands.)
Heidi refuses to do anything else until she knows how to calculate this self-similarity. Could you please help her? (If you would like to instead convince Heidi that a finite string cannot be a fractal anyway – do not bother, we have already tried.)
Input
The input starts with a line indicating the number of test cases T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10). After that, T test cases follow, each of which consists of one line containing a string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100 000) composed of lowercase letters (a-z).
Output
Output T lines, every line containing one number – the answer to the corresponding test case.

Note
A string s contains another string p as a substring if p is a contiguous subsequence of s. For example, ab is a substring of cab but not of acb.
