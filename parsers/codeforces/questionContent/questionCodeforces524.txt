You are given an integer
n
. You have to construct a permutation of size
n
.
A permutation is an array where each integer from
1
to
s
(where
s
is the size of permutation) occurs exactly once. For example,
[2,1,4,3]
is a permutation of size
4
;
[1,2,4,5,3]
is a permutation of size
5
;
[1,4,3]
is not a permutation (the integer
2
is absent),
[2,1,3,1]
is not a permutation (the integer
1
appears twice).
A subsegment of a permutation is a contiguous subsequence of that permutation. For example, the permutation
[2,1,4,3]
has
10
subsegments:
[2]
,
[2,1]
,
[2,1,4]
,
[2,1,4,3]
,
[1]
,
[1,4]
,
[1,4,3]
,
[4]
,
[4,3]
and
[3]
.
The value of the permutation is the number of its subsegments which are also permutations. For example, the value of
[2,1,4,3]
is
3
since the subsegments
[2,1]
,
[1]
and
[2,1,4,3]
are permutations.
You have to construct a permutation of size
n
with minimum possible value among all permutations of size
n
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤48
) — the number of test cases.
Then,
t
lines follow. The
i
-th of them contains one integer
n
(
3≤n≤50
) representing the
i
-th test case.
Output
For each test case, print
n
integers — the permutation of size
n
with minimum possible value. If there are multiple such permutations, print any of them.

Note
In the first example, the permutation
[1,4,3,5,2]
is one of the possible answers; its value is
2
.
In the second example, the permutation
[4,1,6,2,5,3]
is one of the possible answers; its value is
2
.
