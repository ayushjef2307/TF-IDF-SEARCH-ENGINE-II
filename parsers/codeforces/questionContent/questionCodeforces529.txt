Given an array of
n
positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤1000
). Find the maximum value of
i+j
such that
a
i
and
a
j
are coprime,
†
†
or
−1
if no such
i
,
j
exist.
For example consider the array
[1,3,5,2,4,7,7]
. The maximum value of
i+j
that can be obtained is
5+7
, since
a
5
=4
and
a
7
=7
are coprime.
†
†
Two integers
p
and
q
are coprime if the only positive integer that is a divisor of both of them is
1
(that is, their greatest common divisor is
1
).
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤10
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array.
The following line contains
n
space-separated positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,...,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤1000
) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer  — the maximum value of
i+j
such that
i
and
j
satisfy the condition that
a
i
and
a
j
are coprime, or output
−1
in case no
i
,
j
satisfy the condition.

Note
For the first test case, we can choose
i=j=3
, with sum of indices equal to
6
, since
1
and
1
are coprime.
For the second test case, we can choose
i=7
and
j=5
, with sum of indices equal to
7+5=12
, since
7
and
4
are coprime.
