The day is z minutes long, i.e. the day consists of minutes 1, 2, ..., z. How many artists should be killed so that there are no artists in the room when Ilia calls?

Note
Taymyr is a place in the north of Russia.
In the first test the artists come each minute, as well as the calls, so we need to kill all of them.
In the second test we need to kill artists which come on the second and the fourth minutes.
In the third test — only the artist which comes on the sixth minute.
