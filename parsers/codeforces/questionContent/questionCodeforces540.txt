In the world of Compfestnesia, Pak Chanek discovers a secret underground dungeon. Inside it, there is a treasure chest that is surrounded by
n
statues that are arranged in a circular manner. The statues are numbered from
0
to
n−1
with statue
i
being to the left of statue
i+1
and statue
n−1
being to the left of statue
0
.
Pak Chanek observes that each statue is holding a crystal ball with an integer between
0
and
m−1
inclusive. Let's say the integer in the crystal ball of statue
i
is
a
i
.
The dungeon provides instructions that every integer in the crystal balls must be
0
in order to open the treasure chest. To achieve that, Pak Chanek is given an integer
k
, and he can do zero or more operations. In a single operation, Pak Chanek does the following:
Choose exactly
k
consecutive statues. In other words, choose the statues
p,(p+1)modn,(p+2)modn,(p+3)modn,…,(p+k−1)modn
for some chosen index
p
.
Do one of the following:
For all chosen statues, change their values of
a
i
into
(
a
i
+1)modm
.
For all chosen statues, change their values of
a
i
into
(
a
i
−1)modm
.
Help Pak Chanek find the minimum possible number of operations to open the treasure chest.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
, and
k
(
2≤n,m≤
10
6
,
nm≤2⋅
10
6
,
1≤k<n
) — the number of statues, the bound of the integers in the crystal balls, and the number of statues that can be operated in a single operation.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
0
,
a
1
,…,
a
n−1
(
0≤
a
i
<m
) — the integers in the crystal balls.
Output
If it is possible to perform zero or more operations so that
a
0
=
a
1
=…=
a
n−1
=0
, output the minimum number of operations required. Otherwise, output
−1
.

Note
In the first example, Pak Chanek can do the following operations:
Do the
a
i
:=(
a
i
−1)modm
operation
3
times for statues
1
,
2
, and
3
. Now
a=[8,7,1,2,0]
.
Do the
a
i
:=(
a
i
−1)modm
operation
1
time for statues
3
,
4
, and
0
. Now
a=[7,7,1,1,8]
.
Do the
a
i
:=(
a
i
+1)modm
operation
2
times for statues
4
,
0
, and
1
. Now
a=[0,0,1,1,1]
.
Do the
a
i
:=(
a
i
−1)modm
operation
1
time for statues
2
,
3
, and
4
. Now
a=[0,0,0,0,0]
.
