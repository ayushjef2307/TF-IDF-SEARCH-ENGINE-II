Pak Chanek has an
n×m
grid of portals. The portal on the
i
-th row and
j
-th column is denoted as portal
(i,j)
. The portals
(1,1)
and
(n,m)
are on the north-west and south-east corner of the grid respectively.
The portal
(i,j)
has two settings:
Type
t
i,j
, which is either
0
or
1
.
Strength
s
i,j
, which is an integer between
1
and
10
9
inclusive.
Each portal has
4
faces labelled with integers
0,1,2,3
, which correspond to the north, east, south, and west direction respectively.
When a laser enters face
k
of portal
(i,j)
with speed
x
in
, it leaves the portal going out of face
(k+2+
t
i,j
)mod4
with speed
x
out
=max(
x
in
,
s
i,j
)
. The portal also has to consume
x
out
−
x
in
units of energy.
Pak Chanek is very bored today. He will shoot
4nm
lasers with an initial speed of
1
, one into each face of each portal. Each laser will travel throughout this grid of portals until it moves outside the grid or it has passed through
10
100
portals.
At the end, Pak Chanek thinks that a portal is good if and only if the total energy consumed by that portal modulo
2
is equal to its type. Given the strength settings of all portals, find a way to assign the type settings of each portal such that the number of good portals is maximised.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n,m≤1000
) — the number of rows and columns in the grid.
The
i
-th of the next
n
lines contains
m
integers, with the
j
-th integer being
s
i,j
(
1≤
s
i,j
≤
10
9
) — the strength of portal
(i,j)
.
Output
Print
n
lines with each line containing a string of length
m
consisting of characters
0
or
1
representing the type settings. The
j
-th character in the
i
-th string is the type setting of portal
(i,j)
.
If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.

Note
In the first example, let's consider the laser Pak Chanek shoots into face
1
of portal
(2,2)
. The laser travels as follows:
The laser enters face
1
of portal
(2,2)
with speed
1
. It leaves the portal going out of face
3
with speed
5
. Portal
(2,2)
consumes
4
units of energy.
The laser enters face
1
of portal
(2,1)
with speed
5
. It leaves the portal going out of face
0
with speed
6
. Portal
(2,1)
consumes
1
units of energy.
The laser enters face
2
of portal
(1,1)
with speed
6
. It leaves the portal going out of face
1
with speed
8
. Portal
(1,1)
consumes
2
units of energy.
The laser enters face
3
of portal
(1,2)
with speed
8
. It leaves the portal going out of face
2
with speed
8
. Portal
(1,2)
consumes
0
units of energy.
The laser enters face
0
of portal
(2,2)
with speed
8
. It leaves the portal going out of face
2
with speed
8
. Portal
(2,2)
consumes
0
units of energy.
The illustration of the travel of the laser above is as follows.
As an example, consider portal
(2,3)
. We can calculate that the total energy consumed by that portal in the end will be
32
. Since
32mod2=0
and
t
2,3
=0
, then it is a good portal.
