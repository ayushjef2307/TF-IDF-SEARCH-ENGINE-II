Pak Chanek is given an array
a
of
n
integers. For each
i
(
1≤i≤n
), Pak Chanek will write the one-element set
{
a
i
}
on a whiteboard.
After that, in one operation, Pak Chanek may do the following:
Choose two different sets
S
and
T
on the whiteboard such that
S∩T=∅
(
S
and
T
do not have any common elements).
Erase
S
and
T
from the whiteboard and write
S∪T
(the union of
S
and
T
) onto the whiteboard.
After performing zero or more operations, Pak Chanek will construct a multiset
M
containing the sizes of all sets written on the whiteboard. In other words, each element in
M
corresponds to the size of a set after the operations.
How many distinct
†
†
multisets
M
can be created by this process? Since the answer may be large, output it modulo
998244353
.
†
†
Multisets
B
and
C
are different if and only if there exists a value
k
such that the number of elements with value
k
in
B
is different than the number of elements with value
k
in
C
.
Input

Note
In the first example, the possible multisets
M
are
{1,1,1,1,1,1}
,
{1,1,1,1,2}
,
{1,1,1,3}
,
{1,1,2,2}
,
{1,1,4}
,
{1,2,3}
, and
{2,2,2}
.
As an example, let's consider a possible sequence of operations.
In the beginning, the sets are
{1}
,
{1}
,
{2}
,
{1}
,
{4}
, and
{3}
.
Do an operation on sets
{1}
and
{3}
. Now, the sets are
{1}
,
{1}
,
{2}
,
{4}
, and
{1,3}
.
Do an operation on sets
{2}
and

and
{2,4}

{1,2,3,4}
.
The multiset
M
that is constructed is
{1,1,4}
.
