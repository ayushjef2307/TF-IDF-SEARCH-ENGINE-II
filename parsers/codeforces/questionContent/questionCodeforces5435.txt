It's Christmas time! PolandBall and his friends will be giving themselves gifts. There are n Balls overall. Each Ball has someone for whom he should bring a present according to some permutation p, pi ≠ i for all i.
Unfortunately, Balls are quite clumsy. We know earlier that exactly k of them will forget to bring their gift. A Ball number i will get his present if the following two constraints will hold:
Ball number i will bring the present he should give.
Ball x such that px = i will bring his present.
What is minimum and maximum possible number of kids who will not get their present if exactly k Balls will forget theirs?
Input
The first line of input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 106, 0 ≤ k ≤ n), representing the number of Balls and the number of Balls who will forget to bring their presents.
The second line contains the permutation p of integers from 1 to n, where pi is the index of Ball who should get a gift from the i-th Ball. For all i, pi ≠ i holds.
Output
You should output two values — minimum and maximum possible number of Balls who will not get their presents, in that order.

Note
In the first sample, if the third and the first balls will forget to bring their presents, they will be th only balls not getting a present. Thus the minimum answer is 2. However, if the first ans the second balls will forget to bring their presents, then only the fifth ball will get a present. So, the maximum answer is 4.
