PolandBall has such a convex polygon with n veritces that no three of its diagonals intersect at the same point. PolandBall decided to improve it and draw some red segments.
He chose a number k such that gcd(n, k) = 1. Vertices of the polygon are numbered from 1 to n in a clockwise way. PolandBall repeats the following process n times, starting from the vertex 1:
Assume you've ended last operation in vertex x (consider x = 1 if it is the first operation). Draw a new segment from vertex x to k-th next vertex in clockwise direction. This is a vertex x + k or x + k - n depending on which of these is a valid index of polygon's vertex.
Your task is to calculate number of polygon's sections after each drawing. A section is a clear area inside the polygon bounded with drawn diagonals or the polygon's sides.
Input
There are only two numbers in the input: n and k (5 ≤ n ≤ 106, 2 ≤ k ≤ n - 2, gcd(n, k) = 1).
Output
You should print n values separated by spaces. The i-th value should represent number of polygon's sections after drawing first i lines.

Note
The greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers a and b is the largest positive integer that divides both a and b without a remainder.
For the first sample testcase, you should output "2 3 5 8 11". Pictures below correspond to situations after drawing lines.
