PolandBall is a young, clever Ball. He is interested in prime numbers. He has stated a following hypothesis: "There exists such a positive integer n that for each positive integer m number n·m + 1 is a prime number".
Unfortunately, PolandBall is not experienced yet and doesn't know that his hypothesis is incorrect. Could you prove it wrong? Write a program that finds a counterexample for any n.
Input
The only number in the input is n (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — number from the PolandBall's hypothesis.
Output
Output such m that n·m + 1 is not a prime number. Your answer will be considered correct if you output any suitable m such that 1 ≤ m ≤ 103. It is guaranteed the the answer exists.

Note
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
For the first sample testcase, 3·1 + 1 = 4. We can output 1.
In the second sample testcase, 4·1 + 1 = 5. We cannot output 1 because 5 is prime. However, m = 2 is okay since 4·2 + 1 = 9, which is not a prime number.
