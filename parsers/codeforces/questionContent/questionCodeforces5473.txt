A big company decided to launch a new series of rectangular displays, and decided that the display must have exactly n pixels.
Your task is to determine the size of the rectangular display — the number of lines (rows) of pixels a and the number of columns of pixels b, so that:
there are exactly n pixels on the display;
the number of rows does not exceed the number of columns, it means a ≤ b;
the difference b - a is as small as possible.
Input
The first line contains the positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 106) — the number of pixels display should have.
Output
Print two integers — the number of rows and columns on the display.

Note
In the first example the minimum possible difference equals 2, so on the display should be 2 rows of 4 pixels.
In the second example the minimum possible difference equals 0, so on the display should be 8 rows of 8 pixels.
In the third example the minimum possible difference equals 4, so on the display should be 1 row of 5 pixels.
