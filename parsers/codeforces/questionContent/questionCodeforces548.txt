n
. Find a prime number
m
such that
n+m
is not prime.
†
†
A prime number is a number with exactly
2
factors. The first few prime numbers are
2,3,5,7,11,13,…
. In particular,
1
is not a prime number.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.
The only line of each test case contains a prime number
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
).
Output
For each test case, output a line containing a prime number
m
(
2≤m≤
10
5
) such that
n+m
is not prime. It can be proven that under the constraints of the problem, such
m
always exists.
If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.

Note
In the first test case,
m=2
, which is prime, and
n+m=7+2=9
, which is not prime.
In the second test case,
m=7
, which is prime, and
n+m=2+7=9
, which is not prime.
In the third test case,
m=47837
, which is prime, and
n+m=75619+47837=123456
, which is not prime.
