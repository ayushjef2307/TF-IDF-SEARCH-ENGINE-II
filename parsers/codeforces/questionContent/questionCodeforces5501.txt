Note
In the first example Alyona can buy 3 packs of 1 copybook for 3a = 3 rubles in total. After that she will have 4 copybooks which she can split between the subjects equally.
In the second example Alyuna can buy a pack of 2 copybooks for b = 1 ruble. She will have 8 copybooks in total.
In the third example Alyona can split the copybooks she already has between the 4 subject equally, so she doesn't need to buy anything.
In the fourth example Alyona should buy one pack of one copybook.
