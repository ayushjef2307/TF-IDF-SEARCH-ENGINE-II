You are given a rooted tree, consisting of
n
vertices. The vertices are numbered from
1
to
n
, the root is the vertex
1
.
You can perform the following operation at most
k
times:
choose an edge
(v,u)
of the tree such that
v
is a parent of
u
;
remove the edge
(v,u)
;
add an edge
(1,u)
(i. e. make
u
with its subtree a child of the root).
The height of a tree is the maximum depth of its vertices, and the depth of a vertex is the number of edges on the path from the root to it. For example, the depth of vertex
1
is
0
, since it's the root, and the depth of all its children is
1
.
What's the smallest height of the tree that can be achieved?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;
0≤k≤n−1
) — the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum number of operations you can perform.
The second line contains
n−1
integers
p
2
,
p
3
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
<i
) — the parent of the
i
-th vertex. Vertex
1
is the root.
The sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each testcase, print a single integer — the smallest height of the tree that can achieved by performing at most
k
operations.
