You are given an
n×n
grid.
We write
(i,j)
to denote the cell in the
i
-th row and
j
-th column. For each cell, you are told whether yon can delete it or not.
Given an integer
k
, you are asked to delete exactly
(n−k+1
)
2
cells from the grid such that the following condition holds.
You cannot find
k
not deleted cells
(
x
1
,
y
1
),(
x
2
,
y
2
),…,(
x
k
,
y
k
)
that are strictly increasing, i.e.,
x
i
<
x
i+1
and
y
i
<
y
i+1
for all
1≤i<k
.
Your task is to find a solution, or report that it is impossible.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤k≤n≤1000
).
Then
n
lines follow. The
i
-th line contains a binary string
s
i
of length
n
. The
j
-th character of
s
i
is 1 if you can delete cell
(i,j)
, and 0 otherwise.
It's guaranteed that the sum of
n
2
over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each test case, if there is no way to delete exactly
(n−k+1
)
2
cells to meet the condition, output "NO" (without quotes).
Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output
n
lines. The
i
-th line should contain a binary string
t
i
of length
n
. The
j
-th character of
t
i
is 0 if cell
(i,j)
is deleted, and 1 otherwise.
If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
For the first test case, you only have to delete cell
(1,1)
.
For the second test case, you could choose to delete cells
(1,1)
,
(1,2)
,
(4,3)
and
(4,4)
.
For the third test case, it is no solution because the cells in the diagonal will always form a strictly increasing sequence of length
5
.
