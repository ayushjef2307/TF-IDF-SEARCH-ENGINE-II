Given a permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of integers from
1
to
n
, and a threshold
k
with
0≤k≤n
, you compute a sequence
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
as follows.
For every
1≤i≤n
in increasing order, let
x=
a
i
.
If
x≤k
, set
b
x
to the last element
a
j
(
1≤j<i
) that
a
j
>k
. If no such element
a
j
exists, set
b
x
=n+1
.
If
x>k
, set
b
x
to the last element
a
j
(
1≤j<i
) that
a
j
≤k
. If no such element
a
j
exists, set
b
x
=0
.
Unfortunately, after the sequence
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
has been completely computed, the permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and the threshold
k
are discarded.
Now you only have the sequence
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
. Your task is to find any possible permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and threshold
k
that produce the sequence
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and threshold
k
that produce the sequence
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
.
A permutation of integers from
1
to
n
is a sequence of length
n
which contains all integers from
1
to
n
exactly once.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description of each test case.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
), indicating the length of the permutation
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
0≤
b
i
≤n+1
), indicating the elements of the sequence
b
.
It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and threshold
k
that produce the sequence
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output the threshold
k
(
0≤k≤n
) in the first line, and then output the permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
) in the second line such that the permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and threshold
k
produce the sequence
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.

Note
For the first test case, permutation
a=[1,3,2,4]
and threshold
k=2
will produce sequence
b
as follows.
When
i=1
,
x=
a
i
=1≤k
, there is no
a
j
(
1≤j<i
) that
a
j
>k
. Therefore,
b
1
=n+1=5
.
When
i=2
,
x=
a
i
=3>k
, the last element
a
j
that
a
j
≤k
is
a
1
. Therefore,
b
3
=
a
1
=1
.
When
i=3
,
x=
a
i
=2≤k
, the last element
a
j
that
a
j
>k
is
a
2
. Therefore,
b
2
=
a
2
=3
.
When
i=4
,
x=
a
i
=4>k
, the last element
a
j
that
a
j
≤k
is
a
3
. Therefore,
b
4
=
a
3
=2
.
Finally, we obtain sequence
b=[5,3,1,2]
.
For the second test case, permutation
a=[1,2,3,4,5,6]
and threshold
k=3
will produce sequence
b
as follows.
When
i=1,2,3
,
a
i
≤k
, there is no
a
j
(
1≤j<i
) that
a
j
>k
. Therefore,
b
1
=
b
2
=
b
3
=n+1=7
.
When
i=4,5,6
,
a
i
>k
, the last element
a
j
that
a
j
≤k
is
a
3
. Therefore,
b
4
=
b
5
=
b
6
=
a
3
=3
.
Finally, we obtain sequence
b=[7,7,7,3,3,3]
.
For the third test case, permutation
a=[6,5,4,3,2,1]
and threshold
k=3
will produce sequence
b
as follows.
When
i=1,2,3
,
a
i
>k
, there is no
a
j
(
1≤j<i
) that
a
j
≤k
. Therefore,
b
4
=
b
5
=
b
6
=0
.
When
i=4,5,6
,
a
i
≤k
, the last element
a
j
that
a
j
>k
is
a
3
. Therefore,
b
1
=
b
2
=
b
3
=
a
3
=4
.
Finally, we obtain sequence
b=[4,4,4,0,0,0]
.
