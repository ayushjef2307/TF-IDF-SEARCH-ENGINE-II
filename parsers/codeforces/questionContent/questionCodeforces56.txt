Consider an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
consisting of numbers
1
and
−1
. Define
A
-characteristic of this array as a number of pairs of indices
1≤i<j≤n
, such that
a
i
⋅
a
j
=1
.
Find any array
a
with given length
n
with
A
-characteristic equal to the given value
k
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
). The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤100
;
0≤k≤
(n−1)n
2
) — the length of required array and required
A
-characteristic.
Output
For each test case, if there is no array
a
with given
A
-characteristic
k
, print NO.
Otherwise, print YES and
n
numbers
1
and
−1
, which form the required array
a
. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note
In the first test case, there is only one pair of different elements in the array, and their product is
a
1
⋅
a
2
=−1≠1
, hence its
A
-characteristic is
0
.
In the second test case, there is only one pair of different elements in the array, and their product is
a
1
⋅
a
2
=1
, hence its
A
-characteristic is
1
.
In the third test case, there are three pairs of different elements in the array, and their product are:
a
1
⋅
a
2
=−1
,
a
1
⋅
a
3
=1
,
a
2
⋅
a
3
=−1
, hence its
A
-characteristic is
1
.
In the fourth test case, we can show, that there is no array with length
3
, which
A
-characteristic is
2
.
