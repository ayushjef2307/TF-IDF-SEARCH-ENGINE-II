DTL engineers love partying in the weekend. Ela does, too! Unfortunately, she didn't know how to dance yet. Therefore, she decided to take a dancing class.
There are
n
students in the dancing class, including Ela. In the final project,
n
students will participate in a choreography described below.
n
students are positioned on the positive side of the
Ox
-axis. The
i
-th dancer is located at
ai>0
. Some dancers will change positions during the dance (we'll call them movable dancers), and others will stay in the same place during a choreography (we'll call them immovable dancers). We distinguish the dancers using a binary string
s
of length
n
: if
si
equals '1', then the
i
-th dancer is movable, otherwise the
i
-th dancer is immovable.
Let's call the "positive energy value" of the choreography
d>0
. The dancers will perform "movements" based on this value.
Each minute after the dance begins, the movable dancer with the smallest
x
-coordinate will start moving to the right and initiate a "movement". At the beginning of the movement, the dancer's energy level will be initiated equally to the positive energy value of the choreography, which is
d
. Each time they move from some
y
to
y+1
, the energy level will be decreased by
1
. At some point, the dancer might meet other fellow dancers in the same coordinates. If it happens, then the energy level of the dancer will be increased by
1
. A dancer will stop moving to the right when his energy level reaches
0
, and he doesn't share a position with another dancer.
The dancers are very well-trained, and each "movement" will end before the next minute begins.
To show her understanding of this choreography, Ela has to answer
q
queries, each consisting of two integers
k
and
m
. The answer to this query is the coordinate of the
m
-th dancer of both types from the left at
k
-th minute after the choreography begins. In other words, denote
xk,1,xk,2,…,xk,n
as the sorted coordinates of the dancers at
k
-th minute from the beginning, you need to print
xk,m
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
d
and
q
(
1≤n≤105
;
1≤d≤109
;
1≤q≤105
) — the number of dancers, the positive energy value of the choreography, and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤a1<a2<⋯<an≤109
) — the coordinates of each dancer.
The third line contains a binary string
s
of length
n
— the movability of each dancer. Each character is either '0' or '1'. It is guaranteed that
s
contains at least one character '1'.
Then
q
lines follow, the
i
-th of them contains two integers
ki
and
mi
(
1≤ki≤109
,
1≤mi≤n
) — the content of each query.
Output
Output
q
lines, each contains a single integer — the answer for the corresponding query.

Note
Let's consider the first example test case.
In the first minute,
1
is the lowest coordinate between movable dancers. The energy level is initiated with
3
. Then the following happens:
The dancer moves from
1
to
2
. The energy level decreased to
2
.
The dancer moves from
2
to
3
. The energy level decreased to
1
, then increased to
2
when she met another dancer at
3
.
The dancer moves from
3
to
4
. The energy level decreased to
1
.
The dancer moves from
4
to
5
. The energy level decreased to
0
.
At the end of the first minute, the sorted coordinates of the dancers become
[3,5,6,7]
, and their respective movability is '0111'.
In the second minute,
5
is the lowest coordinate between movable dancers. The energy level is initiated with
3
. Then the following happens:
The dancer moves from
5
to
6
. The energy level decreased to
2
, then increased to
3
when she met another dancer at
6
.
The dancer moves from
6
to
7
. The energy level decreased to
2
, then increased to
3
when she met another dancer at
7
.
The dancer moves from
7
to
8
. The energy level decreased to
2
.
The dancer moves from
8
to
9
. The energy level decreased to
1
.
The dancer moves from
9
to
10
. The energy level decreased to
0
.
At the end of the second minute, the sorted coordinates of the dancers become
[3,6,7,10]
, and their respective movability is '0111'.
