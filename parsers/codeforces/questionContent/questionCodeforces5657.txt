Author has gone out of the stories about Vasiliy, so here is just a formal task description.
You are given q queries and a multiset A, initially containing only integer 0. There are three types of queries:
"+ x" — add integer x to multiset A.
"- x" — erase one occurrence of integer x from multiset A. It's guaranteed that at least one x is present in the multiset A before this query.
"? x" — you are given integer x and need to compute the value , i.e. the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (also know as XOR) of integer x and some integer y from the multiset A.
Multiset is a set, where equal elements are allowed.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 200 000) — the number of queries Vasiliy has to perform.
Each of the following q lines of the input contains one of three characters '+', '-' or '?' and an integer xi (1 ≤ xi ≤ 109). It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the third type.
Note, that the integer 0 will always be present in the set A.
Output
For each query of the type '?' print one integer — the maximum value of bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of integer xi and some integer from the multiset A.

Note
After first five operations multiset A contains integers 0, 8, 9, 11, 6 and 1.
The answer for the sixth query is integer  — maximum among integers , , , and .
