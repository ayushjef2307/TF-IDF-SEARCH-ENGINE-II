You're given an array consisting of
n
integers. You have to perform
n
turns.
Initially your score is
0
.
On the
i
-th turn, you are allowed to leave the array as it is or swap any one pair of
2
adjacent elements in the array and change exactly one of them to
0
(and leave the value of other element unchanged) after swapping. In either case(whether you swap or not), after this you add
a
i
to your score.
What's the maximum possible score you can get?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤500
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
6
).
Output
Print a single integer — the maximum possible score.

Note
In the first example, to get the maximum score we do as follows. Do nothing on the first turn, add
3
to the score. Swap the first and the second elements and turn
1
to
0
on the second turn, and add
3
to the score. The final score is
6
.
