Breaking news from zombie neurology! It turns out that – contrary to previous beliefs – every zombie is born with a single brain, and only later it evolves into a complicated brain structure. In fact, whenever a zombie consumes a brain, a new brain appears in its nervous system and gets immediately connected to one of the already existing brains using a single brain connector. Researchers are now interested in monitoring the brain latency of a zombie. Your task is to write a program which, given a history of evolution of a zombie's nervous system, computes its brain latency at every stage.
Input
The first line of the input contains one number n – the number of brains in the final nervous system (2 ≤ n ≤ 200000). In the second line a history of zombie's nervous system evolution is given. For convenience, we number all the brains by 1, 2, ..., n in the same order as they appear in the nervous system (the zombie is born with a single brain, number 1, and subsequently brains 2, 3, ..., n are added). The second line contains n - 1 space-separated numbers p2, p3, ..., pn, meaning that after a new brain k is added to the system, it gets connected to a parent-brain .
Output
Output n - 1 space-separated numbers – the brain latencies after the brain number k is added, for k = 2, 3, ..., n.
