You are given an integer array
a
of length
n
.
Does there exist an array
b
consisting of
n+1
positive integers such that
a
i
=gcd(
b
i
,
b
i+1
)
for all
i
(
1≤i≤n
)?
Note that
gcd(x,y)
denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers
x
and
y
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
space-separated integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
representing the array
a
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
4
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output "YES" if such
b
exists, otherwise output "NO". You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note
In the first test case, we can take
b=[343,343]
.
In the second test case, one possibility for
b
is
b=[12,8,6]
.
In the third test case, it can be proved that there does not exist any array
b
that fulfills all the conditions.
