There was a string
s
which was supposed to be encrypted. For this reason, all
26
lowercase English letters were arranged in a circle in some order, afterwards, each letter in
s
was replaced with the one that follows in clockwise order, in that way the string
t
was obtained.
You are given a string
t
. Determine the lexicographically smallest string
s
that could be a prototype of the given string
t
.
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
of the same length if and only if:
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the string
a
has a letter, that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
b
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤3⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the string
t
.
The next line contains the string
t
of the length
n
, containing lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the lexicographically smallest string
s
which could be a prototype of
t
.

Note
In the first test case, we couldn't have the string "a", since the letter a would transit to itself. Lexicographically the second string "b" is suitable as an answer.
In the second test case, the string "aa" is not suitable, since a would transit to itself. "ab" is not suitable, since the circle would be closed with
2
letters, but it must contain all
26
. The next string "ac" is suitable.
Below you can see the schemes for the first three test cases. The non-involved letters are skipped, they can be arbitrary placed in the gaps.
