There are
n
pieces of tangerine peel, the
i
-th of them has size
a
i
. In one step it is possible to divide one piece of size
x
into two pieces of positive integer sizes
y
and
z
so that
y+z=x
.
You want that for each pair of pieces, their sizes differ strictly less than twice. In other words, there should not be two pieces of size
x
and
y
, such that
2x≤y
. What is the minimum possible number of steps needed to satisfy the condition?
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
).
Then one line follows, containing
n

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of steps.

Note
In the first test case, we initially have a piece of size
1
, so all final pieces must have size
1
. The total number of steps is:
0+1+2+3+4=10
.
In the second test case, we have just one piece, so we don't need to do anything, and the answer is
0
steps.
In the third test case, one of the possible cut options is:
600, 900, (600|700), (1000|1000), (1000|1000|550)
. You can see this option in the picture below. The maximum piece has size
1000
, and it is less than
2
times bigger than the minimum piece of size
550
.
4
steps are done. We can show that it is the minimum possible number of steps.
