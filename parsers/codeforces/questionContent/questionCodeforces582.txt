Let
S
be the Thue-Morse sequence. In other words,
S
is the
0
-indexed binary string with infinite length that can be constructed as follows:
Initially, let
S
be "0".
Then, we perform the following operation infinitely many times: concatenate
S
with a copy of itself with flipped bits.
For example, here are the first four iterations:

You are given two positive integers
n
and
m
. Find the number of positions where the strings
S
0
S
1
…
S
m−1
and
S
n
S
n+1
…
S
n+m−1
are different.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two positive integers,
n
and
m
respectively (
1≤n,m≤
10
18
).
Output
For each testcase, output a non-negative integer — the Hamming distance between the two required strings.

Note
The string
S
is equal to 0110100110010110....
In the first test case,
S
0
is "0", and
S
1
is "1". The Hamming distance between the two strings is
