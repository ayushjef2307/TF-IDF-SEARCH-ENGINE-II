zscoder loves simple strings! A string t is called simple if every pair of adjacent characters are distinct. For example ab, aba, zscoder are simple whereas aa, add are not simple.
zscoder is given a string s. He wants to change a minimum number of characters so that the string s becomes simple. Help him with this task!
Input
The only line contains the string s (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 2·105) — the string given to zscoder. The string s consists of only lowercase English letters.
Output
Print the simple string s' — the string s after the minimal number of changes. If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.
Note that the string s' should also consist of only lowercase English letters.
