For a sequence a of n integers between 1 and m, inclusive, denote f(a) as the number of distinct subsequences of a (including the empty subsequence).
You are given two positive integers n and m. Let S be the set of all sequences of length n consisting of numbers from 1 to m. Compute the sum f(a) over all a in S modulo 109 + 7.
Input
The only line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 106) — the number of elements in arrays and the upper bound for elements.
Output
Print the only integer c — the desired sum modulo 109 + 7.
