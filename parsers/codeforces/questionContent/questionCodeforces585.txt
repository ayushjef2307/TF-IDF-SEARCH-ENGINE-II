You are given a set
S
, which contains the first
n
positive integers:
1,2,…,n
.
You can perform the following operation on
S
any number of times (possibly zero):
Choose a positive integer
k
where
1≤k≤n
, such that there exists a multiple of
k
in
S
. Then, delete the smallest multiple of
k
from
S
. This operation requires a cost of
k
.
You are given a set
T
, which is a subset of
S
. Find the minimum possible total cost of operations such that
S
would be transformed into
T
. We can show that such a transformation is always possible.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤10000
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line contains a single positive integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
6
).
The second line of each test case contains a binary string of length
n
, describing the set
T
. The
i
-th character of the string is '1' if and only if
i
is an element of
T
, and '0' otherwise.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each test case, output one non-negative integer — the minimum possible total cost of operations such that
S
would be transformed into
T
.

Note
In the first test case, we shall not perform any operations as
S
is already equal to
T
, which is the set
{1,2,3,4,5,6}
.
In the second test case, initially,
S={1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
, and
T={1,2,4,7}
. We shall perform the following operations:
Choose
k=3
, then delete
3
from
S
.
Choose
k=3
, then delete
6
from
S
.
Choose
k=5
, then delete
5
from
S
.
The total cost is
3+3+5=11
. It can be shown that this is the smallest cost possible.
In the third test case, initially,
S={1,2,3,4}
and
T={}
(empty set). We shall perform
4
operations of
k=1
to delete
1
,
2
,
3
, and
4
.
In the fourth test case, initially,
S={1,2,3,4}
and
T={3}
. We shall perform two operations with
k=1
to delete
1
and
2
, then perform one operation with
k=2
to delete
4
.
