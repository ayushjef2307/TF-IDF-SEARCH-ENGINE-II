You are given two arrays of integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
and
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
. You need to handle
q
queries of the following two types:
1
l
r
x
: assign
a
i
:=x
for all
l≤i≤r
;
2
l
r
: find the minimum value of the following expression among all
l≤i≤r
:
lcm(
a
i
,
b
i
)
gcd(
a
i
,
b
i
)
.
lcm
(
b
)
In this problem
gcd(x,y)
denotes the greatest common divisor of
x
and
y
, and
lcm(x,y)
denotes the least common multiple of
x
and
y
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n,q≤5⋅
10
4
) — the number of numbers in the arrays
a
and
b
and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤5⋅
10
4
) — the elements of the array
a
.
The third line contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤5⋅
10
4
) — the elements of the array
b
.
Then
q
lines follow,
j
-th of which starts with an integer
t
j
(
1≤
t
j
≤2
) and means that the
j
-th query has type
t
j
.
If
t
j
=1
, it is followed by three integers
l
j
,
r
j
, and
x
j
(
1≤
l
j
≤
r
j
≤n
,
1≤
x
j
≤5⋅
10
4
).
If
t
j
=2
, it is followed by two integers
l
j
and
r
j
(
1≤
l
j
≤
r
j
≤n
).
It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of type
2
.
Output
For each query of the second type, output the minimum value of the expression.

Note
In the first example:
For the first query we can choose
i=4
. So the value is
lcm(4,4)
gcd(4,4)
=
4
4
=1
.
After the second query the array
a=[6,10,15,4,9,25,9,9,9,9]
.
For the third query we can choose
i=9
. So the value is
lcm(9,18)
gcd(9,18)
=
18
9
=2
.
In the second:
For the first query we can choose
i=4
. So the value is
lcm(1,5)
gcd(1,5)
=
5
1
=5
.
After the second query the array
a=[10,18,18,5]
.
After the third query the array
a=[10,10,18,5]
.
For the fourth query we can choose
i=2
. So the value is
lcm(10,12)
gcd(10,12)
=
60
2
=30
.
