This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version there are remove queries.
Initially you have a set containing one element —
0
. You need to handle
q
queries of the following types:
+
x
— add the integer
x
to the set. It is guaranteed that this integer is not contained in the set;
-
x
— remove the integer
x
from the set. It is guaranteed that this integer is contained in the set;
?
k
— find the
k-mex
of the set.
In our problem, we define the
k-mex
of a set of integers as the smallest non-negative integer
x
that is divisible by
k
and which is not contained in the set.
Input
The first line contains an integer
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of queries.
The following
q
lines describe the queries.
An addition query of integer
x
is given in the format +
x
(
1≤x≤
10
18
). It is guaranteed that
x
is not contained in the set.
A remove query of integer
x
is given in the format -
x
(
1≤x≤
10
18
). It is guaranteed that
x
is contained in the set.
A search query of
k-mex
is given in the format ?
k
(
1≤k≤
10
18
).
It is guaranteed that there is at least one query of type ?.
Output
For each query of type ? output a single integer — the
k-mex
of the set.

Note
In the first example:
After the first and second queries, the set will contain elements
{0,1,2}
. The smallest non-negative number that is divisible by
1
and is not in the set is
3
.
After the fourth query, the set will contain the elements
{0,1,2,4}
. The smallest non-negative number that is divisible by
2
and is not in the set is
6
.
In the second example:
Initially, the set contains only the element
{0}
.
After adding an integer
100
the set contains elements
{0,100}
.
100-mex
of the set is
200
.
After adding an integer
200
the set contains elements
{0,100,200}
.
100-mex
of the set
300
.
After removing an integer
100
the set contains elements
{0,200}
.
100-mex
of the set is
100
.
After adding an integer
50
the set contains elements
{0,50,200}
.
50-mex
of the set is
100
.
After removing an integer
50
the set contains elements
{0,200}
.
100-mex
of the set is
50
.
