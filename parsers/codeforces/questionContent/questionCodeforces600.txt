You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. Friends asked you to make the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all numbers in the array equal to
1
. In one operation, you can do the following:
Select an arbitrary index in the array
1≤i≤n
;
Make
a
i
=gcd(
a
i
,i)
, where
gcd(x,y)
denotes the GCD of integers
x
and
y
. The cost of such an operation is
n−i+1
.
You need to find the minimum total cost of operations we need to perform so that the GCD of the all array numbers becomes equal to
1
.
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤5000
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤20
) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the elements of the array.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum total cost of operations that will need to be performed so that the GCD of all numbers in the array becomes equal to
1
.
We can show that it's always possible to do so.

Note
In the first test case, the GCD of the entire array is already equal to
1
, so there is no need to perform operations.
In the second test case, select
i=1
. After this operation,
a
1
=gcd(2,1)=1
. The cost of this operation is
1
.
In the third test case, you can select
i=1
, after that the array
a
will be equal to
[1,4]
. The GCD of this array is
1
, and the total cost is
2
.
In the fourth test case, you can select
i=2
, after that the array
a
will be equal to
[3,2,9]
. The GCD of this array is
1
, and the total cost is
2
.
In the sixth test case, you can select
i=4
and
i=5
, after that the array
a
will be equal to
[120,60,80,4,5]
. The GCD of this array is
1
, and the total cost is
3
.
