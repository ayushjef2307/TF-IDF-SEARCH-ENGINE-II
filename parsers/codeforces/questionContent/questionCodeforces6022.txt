outputstandard output
The array a with n integers is given. Let's call the sequence of one or more consecutive elements in a segment. Also let's call the segment k-good if it contains no more than k different values.
Find any longest k-good segment.
As the input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java.
Input
The first line contains two integers n, k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 5·105) — the number of elements in a and the parameter k.
The second line contains n integers ai (0 ≤ ai ≤ 106) — the elements of the array a.
Output
Print two integers l, r (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the index of the left and the index of the right ends of some k-good longest segment. If there are several longest segments you can print any of them. The elements in a are numbered from 1 to n from left to right.
