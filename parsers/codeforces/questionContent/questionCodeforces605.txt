Demodogs from the Upside-down have attacked Hawkins again. El wants to reach Mike and also kill as many Demodogs in the way as possible.
Hawkins can be represented as an
n×n
grid. The number of Demodogs in a cell at the
i
-th row and the
j
-th column is
i⋅j
. El is at position
(1,1)
of the grid, and she has to reach
(n,n)
where she can find Mike.
The only directions she can move are the right (from
(i,j)
to
(i,j+1)
) and the down (from
(i,j)
to
(i+1,j)
). She can't go out of the grid, as there are doors to the Upside-down at the boundaries.
Calculate the maximum possible number of Demodogs
ans
she can kill on the way, considering that she kills all Demodogs in cells she visits (including starting and finishing cells).

because we are never gonna see it again!
(Note, you firstly multiply by

and only after that take the remainder.)
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤

) — the size of the grid.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum number of Demodogs that can be killed multiplied by
2022
, modulo

Note
In the first test case, for any path chosen by her the number of Demodogs to be killed would be
7
, so the answer would be
2022⋅7=14154
