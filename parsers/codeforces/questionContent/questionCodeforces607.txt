You are given a permutation
p
of length
n
and a positive integer
k
. Consider a permutation
q
of length
n
such that for any integers
i
and
j
, where
1≤i<j≤n
, we have
p
q
i
≤
p
q
j
+k.
k
Find the minimum possible number of inversions in a permutation
q
.
A permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
An inversion in a permutation
a
is a pair of indices
i
and
j
(
1≤i,j≤n
) such that
i<j
, but
a
i
>
a
j
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤5000
,
1≤k≤8
).
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
).
Output
Print the minimum possible number of inversions in the permutation
q
.

Note
In the first example, the only permutation is
q=[1]
(
0
inversions). Then
p
