You are given an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of positive integers.
Find the number of pairs of indices
(l,r)
, where
1≤l≤r≤n
, that pass the check. The check is performed in the following manner:
The minimum and maximum numbers are found among
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
.
The check is passed if the maximum number is divisible by the minimum number.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤10
) — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case consists of two lines.
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
) — the size of the array.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
6
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the number of pairs of indices that pass the check.

Note
Below
x∣y
denotes that
y
is divisible by
x
.
In the first test case, there is one pair
(1,1)
, the maximum for this pair is
1
, the minimum is also
1
,
1∣1
, so the check is passed, and the answer is
1
.
In the second test case, there are
3
segments:
(1,1)
: the maximum is
2
, the minimum is
2
,
2∣2
, so the check is passed.
(1,2)
: the maximum is
4
, the minimum is
2
,
2∣4
, so the check is passed.
(2,2)
: the maximum is
4
, the minimum is
4
,
4∣4
, so the check is passed.
In the third test case, there are
3
segments:
(1,1)
: the maximum is
2
, the minimum is
2
,
2∣2
, so the check is passed.
(1,2)
: the maximum is
3
, the minimum is
2
,
3
isn't divisible by
2
, so the check is failed.
(2,2)
: the maximum is
3
, the minimum is
3
,
3∣3
, so the check is passed.
