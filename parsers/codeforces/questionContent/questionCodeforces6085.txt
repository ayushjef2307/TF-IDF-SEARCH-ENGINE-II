After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.
You're given a number X represented in base bx and a number Y represented in base by. Compare those two numbers.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and bx (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ bx ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the bx-based representation of X.
The second line contains n space-separated integers x1, x2, ..., xn (0 ≤ xi < bx) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.
The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and by (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ by ≤ 40, bx ≠ by), where m is the number of digits in the by-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y1, y2, ..., ym (0 ≤ yi < by) — the digits of Y.
There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.
Output
Output a single character (quotes for clarity):
'<' if X < Y
'>' if X > Y
'=' if X = Y

Note
In the first sample, X = 1011112 = 4710 = Y.
In the second sample, X = 1023 = 215 and Y = 245 = 1123, thus X < Y.
In the third sample, and Y = 48031509. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and bx is much larger than by, so X is clearly larger than Y.
