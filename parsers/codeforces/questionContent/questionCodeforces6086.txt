There's a famous museum in the city where Kleofáš lives. In the museum, n exhibits (numbered 1 through n) had been displayed for a long time; the i-th of those exhibits has value vi and mass wi.
Then, the museum was bought by a large financial group and started to vary the exhibits. At about the same time, Kleofáš... gained interest in the museum, so to say.
You should process q events of three types:
type 1 — the museum displays an exhibit with value v and mass w; the exhibit displayed in the i-th event of this type is numbered n + i (see sample explanation for more details)
type 2 — the museum removes the exhibit with number x and stores it safely in its vault
type 3 — Kleofáš visits the museum and wonders (for no important reason at all, of course): if there was a robbery and exhibits with total mass at most m were stolen, what would their maximum possible total value be?
For each event of type 3, let s(m) be the maximum possible total value of stolen exhibits with total mass  ≤ m.
Formally, let D be the set of numbers of all exhibits that are currently displayed (so initially D = {1, ..., n}). Let P(D) be the set of all subsets of D and let
Then, s(m) is defined as
Compute s(m) for each . Note that the output follows a special format.
Input
The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1000) — the initial number of exhibits in the museum and the maximum interesting mass of stolen exhibits.
Then, n lines follow. The i-th of them contains two space-separated positive integers vi and wi (1 ≤ vi ≤ 1 000 000, 1 ≤ wi ≤ 1000) — the value and mass of the i-th exhibit.
The next line contains a single integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 30 000) — the number of events.
Each of the next q lines contains the description of one event in the following format:
1 v w — an event of type 1, a new exhibit with value v and mass w has been added (1 ≤ v ≤ 1 000 000, 1 ≤ w ≤ 1000)
2 x — an event of type 2, the exhibit with number x has been removed; it's guaranteed that the removed exhibit had been displayed at that time
3 — an event of type 3, Kleofáš visits the museum and asks his question
There will be at most 10 000 events of type 1 and at least one event of type 3.
Output
As the number of values s(m) can get large, output the answers to events of type 3 in a special format.
For each event of type 3, consider the values s(m) computed for the question that Kleofáš asked in this event; print one line containing a single number
where p = 107 + 19 and q = 109 + 7.
Print the answers to events of type 3 in the order in which they appear in the input.

Note
In the first sample, the numbers of displayed exhibits and values s(1), ..., s(10) for individual events of type 3 are, in order:
The values of individual exhibits are v1 = 30, v2 = 60, v3 = 5, v4 = 42, v5 = 20, v6 = 40 and their masses are w1 = 4, w2 = 6, w3 = 1, w4 = 5, w5 = 3, w6 = 6.
In the second sample, the only question is asked after removing all exhibits, so s(m) = 0 for any m.
