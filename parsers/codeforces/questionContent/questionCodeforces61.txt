A permutation is a sequence
n
integers, where each integer from
1
to
n
appears exactly once. For example,
[1]
,
[3,5,2,1,4]
,
[1,3,2]
are permutations, while
[2,3,2]
,
[4,3,1]
,
[0]
are not.
Given a permutation
a
, we construct an array
b
, where
b
i
=(
a
1
+
a
2
+ … +
a
i
)modn
.
A permutation of numbers
[
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
]
is called a super-permutation if
[
b
1
+1,
b
2
+1,…,
b
n
+1]
is also a permutation of length
n
.
Grisha became interested whether a super-permutation of length
n
exists. Help him solve this non-trivial problem. Output any super-permutation of length
n
, if it exists. Otherwise, output
−1
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
Each test case consists of a single line containing one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the desired permutation.
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output in a separate line:
n
integers — a super-permutation of length
n
, if it exists.
−1
, otherwise.
If there are several suitable permutations, output any of them.
