In this problem you are to calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to n, but you should take all powers of two with minus in the sum.
For example, for n = 4 the sum is equal to  - 1 - 2 + 3 - 4 =  - 4, because 1, 2 and 4 are 20, 21 and 22 respectively.
Calculate the answer for t values of n.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the number of values of n to be processed.
Each of next t lines contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 109).
Output
Print the requested sum for each of t integers n given in the input.
