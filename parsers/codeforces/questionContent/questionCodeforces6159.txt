Olesya loves numbers consisting of n digits, and Rodion only likes numbers that are divisible by t. Find some number that satisfies both of them.
Your task is: given the n and t print an integer strictly larger than zero consisting of n digits that is divisible by t. If such number doesn't exist, print  - 1.
Input
The single line contains two numbers, n and t (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 2 ≤ t ≤ 10) — the length of the number and the number it should be divisible by.
Output
Print one such positive number without leading zeroes, — the answer to the problem, or  - 1, if such number doesn't exist. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print any of them.
