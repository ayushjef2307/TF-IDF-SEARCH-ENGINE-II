You are given a string S of length n with each character being one of the first m lowercase English letters.
Calculate how many different strings T of length n composed from the first m lowercase English letters exist such that the length of LCS (longest common subsequence) between S and T is n - 1.
Recall that LCS of two strings S and T is the longest string C such that C both in S and T as a subsequence.
Input
The first line contains two numbers n and m denoting the length of string S and number of first English lowercase characters forming the character set for strings (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, 2 ≤ m ≤ 26).
The second line contains string S.
Output
Print the only line containing the answer.

Note
For the first sample, the 6 possible strings T are: aab, aac, aba, aca, baa, caa.
For the second sample, the 11 possible strings T are: aaa, aac, aba, abb, abc, aca, acb, baa, bab, caa, cab.
For the third sample, the only possible string T is b.
