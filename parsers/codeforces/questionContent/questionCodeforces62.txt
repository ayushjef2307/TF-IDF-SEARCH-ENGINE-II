Tema loves cinnabon rolls — buns with cinnabon and chocolate in the shape of a "snail".
Cinnabon rolls come in different sizes and are square when viewed from above. The most delicious part of a roll is the chocolate, which is poured in a thin layer over the cinnabon roll in the form of a spiral and around the bun, as in the following picture:
Cinnabon rolls of sizes 4, 5, 6
For a cinnabon roll of size
n
, the length of the outer side of the square is
n
, and the length of the shortest vertical chocolate segment in the central part is one.
Formally, the bun consists of two dough spirals separated by chocolate. A cinnabon roll of size
n+1
is obtained from a cinnabon roll of size
n
by wrapping each of the dough spirals around the cinnabon roll for another layer.
It is important that a cinnabon roll of size
n
is defined in a unique way.
Tema is interested in how much chocolate is in his cinnabon roll of size
n
. Since Tema has long stopped buying small cinnabon rolls, it is guaranteed that
n≥4
.
Answer this non-obvious question by calculating the total length of the chocolate layer.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases.
The following
t
lines describe the test cases.
Each test case is described by a single integer
n
(
4≤n≤
10
9
) — the size of the cinnabon roll.
Output
Output
t
integers. The
i
-th of them should be equal to the total length of the chocolate layer in the
i
-th test case.
