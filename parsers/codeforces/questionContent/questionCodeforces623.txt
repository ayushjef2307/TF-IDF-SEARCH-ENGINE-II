Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, they are given a non-empty string
s
, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string is even. Each player also has a string of their own, initially empty.
Alice starts, then they alternate moves. In one move, a player takes either the first or the last letter of the string
s
, removes it from
s
and prepends (adds to the beginning) it to their own string.
The game ends when the string
s
becomes empty. The winner is the player with a lexicographically smaller string. If the players' strings are equal, then it's a draw.
A string
a
is lexicographically smaller than a string
b
if there exists such position
i
that
a
j
=
b
j
for all
j<i
and
a
i
<
b
i
.
What is the result of the game if both players play optimally (e. g. both players try to win; if they can't, then try to draw)?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of testcases.
Each testcase consists of a single line — a non-empty string
s
, consisting of lowercase Latin letters. The length of the string
s
is even.
The total length of the strings over all testcases doesn't exceed
2000
.
Output
For each testcase, print the result of the game if both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print "Alice". If Bob wins, print "Bob". If it's a draw, print "Draw".

Note
One of the possible games Alice and Bob can play in the first testcase:
Alice picks the first letter in
s
:
s=
"orces",
a=
"f",
b=
"";
Bob picks the last letter in
s
:
s=
"orce",
a=
"f",
b=
"s";
Alice picks the last letter in
s
:
s=
"orc",
a=
"ef",
b=
"s";
Bob picks the first letter in
s
:
s=
"rc",
a=
"ef",
b=
"os";
Alice picks the last letter in
s
:
s=
"r",
a=
"cef",
b=
"os";
Bob picks the remaining letter in
s
:
s=
"",
a=
"cef",
b=
"ros".
Alice wins because "cef" < "ros". Neither of the players follows any strategy in this particular example game, so it doesn't show that Alice wins if both play optimally.
