A permutation
p
of length
n
is called almost perfect if for all integer
1≤i≤n
, it holds that
|
p
i
−
p
−1
i
|≤1
, where
p
−1
is the inverse permutation of
p
(i.e.
p
−1
k
1
=
k
2
if and only if
p
k
2
=
k
1
).
Count the number of almost perfect permutations of length
n
modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. The description of each test case follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤3⋅
10
5
) — the length of the permutation.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
3⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of almost perfect permutations of length
n
modulo
998244353
.

Note
For
n=2
, both permutations
[1,2]
, and
[2,1]
are almost perfect.
For
n=3
, there are only
6
permutations. Having a look at all of them gives us:
[1,2,3]
is an almost perfect permutation.
[1,3,2]
is an almost perfect permutation.
[2,1,3]
is an almost perfect permutation.
[2,3,1]
is NOT an almost perfect permutation (
|
p
2
−
p
−1
2
|=|3−1|=2
).
[3,1,2]
is NOT an almost perfect permutation (
|
p

−
p
−1
2
|=|1−3|=2
).
[3,2,1]
is an almost perfect permutation.
So we get
4
almost perfect permutations.
