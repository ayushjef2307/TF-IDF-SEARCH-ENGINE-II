You really love to listen to music. During the each of next s days you will listen to exactly m songs from the playlist that consists of exactly n songs. Let's number the songs from the playlist with numbers from 1 to n, inclusive. The quality of song number i is ai.
On the i-th day you choose some integer v (li ≤ v ≤ ri) and listen to songs number v, v + 1, ..., v + m - 1. On the i-th day listening to one song with quality less than qi increases your displeasure by exactly one.
Determine what minimum displeasure you can get on each of the s next days.
Input
The first line contains two positive integers n, m (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 2·105). The second line contains n positive integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai < 230) — the description of songs from the playlist.
The next line contains a single number s (1 ≤ s ≤ 2·105) — the number of days that you consider.
The next s lines contain three integers each li, ri, xi (1 ≤ li ≤ ri ≤ n - m + 1; 0 ≤ xi < 230) — the description of the parameters for the i-th day. In order to calculate value qi, you need to use formula: , where ansi is the answer to the problem for day i. Assume that ans0 = 0.
Output
Print exactly s integers ans1, ans2, ..., anss, where ansi is the minimum displeasure that you can get on day i.
