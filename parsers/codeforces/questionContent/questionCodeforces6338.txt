Tavas is a cheerleader in the new sports competition named "Pashmaks".
This competition consists of two part: swimming and then running. People will immediately start running R meters after they finished swimming exactly S meters. A winner is a such person that nobody else finishes running before him/her (there may be more than one winner).
Before the match starts, Tavas knows that there are n competitors registered for the match. Also, he knows that i-th person's swimming speed is si meters per second and his/her running speed is ri meters per second. Unfortunately, he doesn't know the values of R and S, but he knows that they are real numbers greater than 0.
As a cheerleader, Tavas wants to know who to cheer up. So, he wants to know all people that might win. We consider a competitor might win if and only if there are some values of R and S such that with these values, (s)he will be a winner.
Tavas isn't really familiar with programming, so he asked you to help him.
Input
