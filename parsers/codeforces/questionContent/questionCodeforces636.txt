Pak Chanek is participating in a lemper cooking competition. In the competition, Pak Chanek has to cook lempers with
N
stoves that are arranged sequentially from stove
1
to stove
N
. Initially, stove
i
has a temperature of
A
i
degrees. A stove can have a negative temperature.
Pak Chanek realises that, in order for his lempers to be cooked, he needs to keep the temperature of each stove at a non-negative value. To make it happen, Pak Chanek can do zero or more operations. In one operation, Pak Chanek chooses one stove
i
with
2≤i≤N−1
, then:
changes the temperature of stove
i−1
into
A
i−1
:=
A
i−1
+
A
i
,
changes the temperature of stove
i+1
into
A
i+1
:=
A
i+1
+
A
i
, and
changes the temperature of stove
i
into
A
i
:=−
A
i
.
Pak Chanek wants to know the minimum number of operations he needs to do such that the temperatures of all stoves are at non-negative values. Help Pak Chanek by telling him the minimum number of operations needed or by reporting if it is not possible to do.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
N
(
1≤N≤
10
5
) — the number of stoves.
The second line contains
N
integers
A
1
,
A
2
,…,
A
N
(
−
10
9
≤
A
i
≤
10
9
) — the initial temperatures of the stoves.
Output
Output an integer representing the minimum number of operations needed to make the temperatures of all stoves at non-negative values or output
−1
if it is not possible.

Note
For the first example, a sequence of operations that can be done is as follows:
Pak Chanek does an operation to stove
3
,
A=[2,−2,1,4,2,−2,9]
.
Pak Chanek does an operation to stove
2
,
A=[0,2,−1,4,2,−2,9]
.
Pak Chanek does an operation to stove

,
A=[0,1,1,3,2,−2,9]
.
Pak Chanek does an operation to stove
6
,
A=[0,1,1,3,0,2,7]
.
There is no other sequence of operations such that the number of operations needed is fewer than
4
.
