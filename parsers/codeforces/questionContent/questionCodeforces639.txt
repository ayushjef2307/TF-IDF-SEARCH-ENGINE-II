Pak Chanek has a tree called the key tree. This tree consists of
N
vertices and
N−1
edges. The edges of the tree are numbered from
1
to
N−1
with edge
i
connecting vertices
U
i
and
V
i
. Initially, each edge of the key tree does not have a weight.
Formally, a path with length
k
in a graph is a sequence
[
v
1
,
e
1
,
v
2
,
e
2
,
v
3
,
e
3
,…,
v
k
,
e
k
,
v
k+1
]
such that:
For each
i
,
v
i
is a vertex and
e
i
is an edge.
For each
i
,
e
i
connects vertices
v
i
and
v
i+1
.
A circuit is a path that starts and ends on the same vertex.
A path in a graph is said to be simple if and only if the path does not use the same edge more than once. Note that a simple path can use the same vertex more than once.
The cost of a simple path in a weighted graph is defined as the maximum weight of all edges it traverses.
Count the number of distinct undirected weighted graphs that satisfy the following conditions:
The graph has
N
vertices and
2N−2
edges.
For each pair of different vertices
(x,y)
, there exists a simple circuit that goes through vertices
x
and
y
in the graph.
The weight of each edge in the graph is an integer between
1
and
2N−2
inclusive. Each edge has distinct weights.
The graph is formed in a way such that there is a way to assign a weight
W
i
to each edge
i
in the key tree that satisfies the following conditions:
For each pair of edges
(i,j)
, if
i<j
, then
W
i
<
W
j
.
For each pair of different vertex indices
(x,y)
, the cost of the only simple path from vertex
x
to
y
in the key tree is equal to the minimum cost of a simple circuit that goes through vertices
x
and
y
in the graph.
Note that the graph is allowed to have multi-edges, but is not allowed to have self-loops.

Two graphs are considered distinct if and only if there exists a triple
(a,b,c)
such that there exists an edge that connects vertices
a
and
b
with weight
c
in one graph, but not in the other.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
N
(
2≤N≤
10
5
) — the number of vertices in the key tree.
The
i
-th of the next
N−1
lines contains two integers
U
i
and
V
i

i
,
V
i

) — an edge connecting vertices
U
i
and
V
i
. The graph in the input is a tree.
