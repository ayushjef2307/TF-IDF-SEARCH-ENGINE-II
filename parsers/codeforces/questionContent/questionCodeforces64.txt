Mushroom Filippov cooked himself a meal and while having his lunch, he decided to watch a video on TubeTube. He can not spend more than
t
seconds for lunch, so he asks you for help with the selection of video.
The TubeTube feed is a list of
n
videos, indexed from

seconds. If there are several of them, he wants to choose the most entertaining one. Print the index of any appropriate video, or
−1
if there is no such.

The first line of the input data contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤1000
) — the number of test cases in the test.
The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of a test case contains two integers
n
and
t
(
1≤n≤50
,
1≤t≤200
) — the number of videos in the feed and seconds for lunch, respectively.
The second line of a test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,
a
3
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤100
) — durations of videos.
