Pak Chanek plans to build a garage. He wants the garage to consist of a square and a right triangle that are arranged like the following illustration.
Define
a
and
b
as the lengths of two of the sides in the right triangle as shown in the illustration. An integer
x
is suitable if and only if we can construct a garage with assigning positive integer values for the lengths
a
and
b
(
a<b
) so that the area of the square at the bottom is exactly
x
. As a good friend of Pak Chanek, you are asked to help him find the
N
-th smallest suitable number.
Input
The only line contains a single integer
N
(
1≤N≤
10
9
).
Output
An integer that represents the
N
-th smallest suitable number.
Example
input
Copy
3
output
Copy
7
Note
The
3
-rd smallest suitable number is
7
. A square area of
7
can be obtained by assigning
a=3
and
b=4
.
