Let's say Pak Chanek has an array
A
consisting of
N
positive integers. Pak Chanek will do a number of operations. In each operation, Pak Chanek will do the following:
Choose an index
p
(
1≤p≤N
).
Let
c
be the number of operations that have been done on index
p
before this operation.
Decrease the value of
A
p
by
2
c
.
Multiply the value of
A
p
by
2
.
After each operation, all elements of
A
must be positive integers.
An array
A
is said to be sortable if and only if Pak Chanek can do zero or more operations so that
A
1
<
A
2
<
A
3
<
A
4
<…<
A
N
.
Pak Chanek must find an array
A
that is sortable with length
N
such that
A
1
+
A
2
+
A
3
+
A
4
+…+
A
N
is the minimum possible. If there are more than one possibilities, Pak Chanek must choose the array that is lexicographically minimum among them.
Pak Chanek must solve the following things:
Pak Chanek must print the value of
A
1
+
A
2
+
A
3
+
A
4
+…+
A
N
for that array.
Q
questions will be given. For the
i
-th question, an integer
P
i
is given. Pak Chanek must print the value of
A
P
i
.
Help Pak Chanek solve the problem.
Note: an array
B
of size
N
is said to be lexicographically smaller than an array
C
that is also of size
N
if and only if there exists an index
i
such that
B
i
<
C
i
and for each
j<i
,
B
j
=
C
j
.
Input
The first line contains two integers
N
and
Q
(
1≤N≤
10
9
,
0≤Q≤min(N,
10
5
)
) — the required length of array
A
and the number of questions.
The
i
-th of the next
Q
lines contains a single integer
P
i
(
1≤
P
1
<
P
2
<…<
P
Q
≤N
) — the index asked in the
i
-th question.
Output
Print
Q+1
lines. The
1
-st line contains an integer representing
A
1
+
A
2
+
A
3

A
4
+…+
A
N
. For each
1≤i≤Q
, the
(i+1)
-th line contains an integer representing
A
P
i
.

Note
In the first example, the array
A
obtained is
[1,2,3,3,4,4]
. We can see that the array is sortable by doing the following operations:
Choose index
5
, then
A=[1,2,3,3,6,4]
.
Choose index
6
, then
A=[1,2,3,3,6,6]
.
Choose index
4
, then
A=[1,2,3,4,6,6]
.
Choose index
6
, then
A=[1,2,3,4,6,8]
.
