There is a beautiful alley with trees in front of a shopping mall. Unfortunately, it has to go to make space for the parking lot.
The trees on the alley all grow in a single line. There are
n
spots for trees, index
0
is the shopping mall, index
n+1
is the road and indices from
1
to
n
are the spots for trees. Some of them are taken — there grow trees of the same height
k
. No more than one tree grows in each spot.
When you chop down a tree in the spot
x
, you can make it fall either left or right. If it falls to the left, it takes up spots from
x−k
to
x
, inclusive. If it falls to the right, it takes up spots from
x
to
x+k
, inclusive.
Let
m
trees on the alley grow in some spots
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
m
. Let an alley be called unfortunate if all
m
trees can be chopped down in such a way that:
no tree falls on the shopping mall or the road;
each spot is taken up by no more than one fallen tree.
Calculate the number of different unfortunate alleys with
m
trees of height
k
. Two alleys are considered different if there is a spot
y
such that a tree grows in
y
on the first alley and doesn't grow in
y
on the second alley.
Output the number modulo
998244353
.
Input
The only line contains three integers
n,m
and
k
(
1≤m,k≤n≤3⋅
10
5
) — the number of spots for the trees, the number of trees and the height of each tree.
Output
Print a single integer — the number of different unfortunate alleys with
m
trees of height
k
, modulo
998244353
.
