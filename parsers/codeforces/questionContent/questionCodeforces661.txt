Misha has a square
n×n
matrix, where the number in row
i
and column
j
is equal to
a
i,j
. Misha wants to modify the matrix to contain exactly
k
distinct integers. To achieve this goal, Misha can perform the following operation zero or more times:
choose any square submatrix of the matrix (you choose
(
x
1
,
y
1
)
,
(
x
2
,
y
2
)
, such that
x
1
≤
x
2
,
y
1
≤
y
2
,
x
2
−
x
1
=
y
2
−
y
1
, then submatrix is a set of cells with coordinates
(x,y)
, such that
x
1
≤x≤
x
2
,
y
1
≤y≤
y
2
),
choose an integer
k
, where
1≤k≤
n
2
,
replace all integers in the submatrix with
k
.
Please find the minimum number of operations that Misha needs to achieve his goal.
Input
The first input line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤500,1≤k≤
n
2
)  — the size of the matrix and the desired amount of distinct elements in the matrix.
Then
n
lines follows. The
i
-th of them contains
n
integers
a
i,1
,
a
i,2
,…,
a
i,n
(
1≤
a
i,j
≤
n
2
) — the elements of the
i
-th row of the matrix.
Output
Output one integer — the minimum number of operations required.

Note
In the first test case the answer is
1
, because one can change the value in the bottom right corner of the matrix to
1
. The resulting matrix can be found below:
1 1 1
1 1 2
3 4 1
In the second test case the answer is
2
. First, one can change the entire matrix to contain only
1
s, and the change the value of any single cell to
2
. One of the possible resulting matrices is displayed below:
1 1 1
1 1 1
1 1 2
