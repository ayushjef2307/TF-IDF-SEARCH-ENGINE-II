You are given an array
a
that contains
n
integers. You can choose any proper subsegment
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
of this array, meaning you can choose any two integers
1≤l≤r≤n
, where
r−l+1<n
. We define the beauty of a given subsegment as the value of the following expression:
max(
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
l−1
,
a
r+1
,
a
r+2
,…,
a
n

)+max(
a

a

)−min(

).

Please find the maximum beauty among all proper subsegments.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of each test case.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(4≤n≤
10
5
)
— the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the elements of the given array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each testcase print a single integer — the maximum beauty of a proper subsegment.

Note
In the first test case, the optimal segment is
l=7
,
r=8
. The beauty of this segment equals to
(6−1)+(5−1)=9
.
In the second test case, the optimal segment is
l=2
,
r=4
. The beauty of this segment equals
(100−2)+(200−1)=297
.
