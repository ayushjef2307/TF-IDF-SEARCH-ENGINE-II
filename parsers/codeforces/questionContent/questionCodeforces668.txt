A new entertainment has appeared in Buryatia — a mathematical circus! The magician shows two numbers to the audience —
n
and
k
, where
n
is even. Next, he takes all the integers from
1
to
n
, and splits them all into pairs
(a,b)
(each integer must be in exactly one pair) so that for each pair the integer
(a+k)⋅b
is divisible by
4
(note that the order of the numbers in the pair matters), or reports that, unfortunately for viewers, such a split is impossible.
Burenka really likes such performances, so she asked her friend Tonya to be a magician, and also gave him the numbers
n
and
k
.
Tonya is a wolf, and as you know, wolves do not perform in the circus, even in a mathematical one. Therefore, he asks you to help him. Let him know if a suitable splitting into pairs is possible, and if possible, then tell it.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The following is a description of the input data sets.
The single line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
0≤k≤
10
9
,
n
is even) — the number of integers and the number being added
k
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, first output the string "YES" if there is a split into pairs, and "NO" if there is none.
If there is a split, then in the following
n
2
lines output pairs of the split, in each line print
2
numbers — first the integer
a
, then the integer
b
.

Note
In the first test case, splitting into pairs
(1,2)
and
(3,4)
is suitable, same as splitting into
(1,4)
and
(3,2)
.
In the second test case,
(1+0)⋅2=1⋅(2+0)=2
is not divisible by
4
, so there is no partition.
