This is the hard version of this problem. The difference between easy and hard versions is only the constraints on
a
i
and on
n
. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
Burenka is the crown princess of Buryatia, and soon she will become the
n
-th queen of the country. There is an ancient tradition in Buryatia — before the coronation, the ruler must show their strength to the inhabitants. To determine the strength of the
n
-th ruler, the inhabitants of the country give them an array of
a
of exactly
n
numbers, after which the ruler must turn all the elements of the array into zeros in the shortest time. The ruler can do the following two-step operation any number of times:
select two indices
l
and
r
, so that
1≤l≤r≤n
and a non-negative integer
x
, then
for all
l≤i≤r
assign
a
i
:=
a
i
⊕x
, where
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation. It takes
⌈
r−l+1
2
⌉
seconds to do this operation, where
⌈y⌉
denotes
y
rounded up to the nearest integer.
Help Burenka calculate how much time she will need.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤500)
 — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(1≤n≤
10
5
)
- the size of the array
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,⋯,
a
n
(0≤
a
i
<
2
30
)
 — elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
in all tests does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single number  — the minimum time that Burenka will need.

Note
In the first test case, Burenka can choose segment
l=1
,
r=4
, and
x=5
. so it will fill the array with zeros in
2
seconds.
In the second test case, Burenka first selects segment
l=1
,
r=2
, and
x=1
, after which
a=[0,2,2]
, and then the segment
l=2
,
r=3
, and
x=2
, which fills the array with zeros. In total, Burenka will spend
2
seconds.
