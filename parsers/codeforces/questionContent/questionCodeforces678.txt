Madoka wants to enter to "Novosibirsk State University", but in the entrance exam she came across a very difficult task:
Given an integer
n
, it is required to calculate
∑lcm(c,gcd(a,b))
, for all triples of positive integers
(a,b,c)
, where
a+b+c=n
.
In this problem
gcd(x,y)
denotes the greatest common divisor of
x
and
y
, and
lcm(x,y)
denotes the least common multiple of
x
and
y
.
Solve this problem for Madoka and help her to enter to the best university!
Input
The first and the only line contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤
10
5
).
Output
Print exactly one interger —
∑lcm(c,gcd(a,b))
. Since the answer can be very large, then output it modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
In the first example, there is only one suitable triple
(1,1,1)
. So the answer is
lcm(1,gcd(1,1))=lcm(1,1)=1
.
In the second example,
lcm(1,gcd(3,1))+lcm(1,gcd(2,2))+lcm(1,gcd(1,3))+lcm(2,gcd(2,1))+lcm(2,gcd(1,2))+lcm(3,gcd(1,1))=lcm(1,1)+lcm(1,2)+lcm(1,1)+lcm(2,1)+lcm(2,1)+lcm(3,1)=1+2+1+2+2+3=11
