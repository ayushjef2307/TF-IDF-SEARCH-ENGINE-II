Madoka is a very strange girl, and therefore she suddenly wondered how many pairs of integers
(a,b)
exist, where
1≤a,b≤n
, for which
lcm(a,b)
gcd(a,b)
≤3
.
In this problem,
gcd(a,b)
denotes the greatest common divisor of the numbers
a
and
b
, and
lcm(a,b)
denotes the smallest common multiple of the numbers
a
and
b
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first and the only line of each test case contains the integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
8
).
Output
For each test case output a single integer — the number of pairs of integers satisfying the condition.

Note
For
n=1
there is exactly one pair of numbers —
(1,1)
and it fits.
For
n=2
, there are only
4
pairs —
(1,1)
,
(1,2)
,
(2,1)
,
(2,2)
and they all fit.
For
n=3
, all
9
pair are suitable, except
(2,3)
and
(3,2)
, since their
lcm
is
6
, and
gcd
is
1
, which doesn't fit the condition.
