There are
n
bags, each bag contains
m
balls with numbers from
1
to
m
. For every
i∈[1,m]
, there is exactly one ball with number
i
in each bag.
You have to take exactly one ball from each bag (all bags are different, so, for example, taking the ball
1
from the first bag and the ball
2
from the second bag is not the same as taking the ball
2
from the first bag and the ball
1
from the second bag). After that, you calculate the number of balls with odd numbers among the ones you have taken. Let the number of these balls be
F
.
Your task is to calculate the sum of
F
k
over all possible ways to take
n
balls, one from each bag.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤5000
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing three integers
n
,
m
and
k
(
1≤n,m≤998244352
;
1≤k≤2000
).
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the sum of
F
k
over all possible ways to take
n
balls, one from each bag. Since it can be huge, print it modulo
998244353
.
