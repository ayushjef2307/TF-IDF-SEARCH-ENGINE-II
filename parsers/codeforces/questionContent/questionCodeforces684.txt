You are given an array of length
2
n
. The elements of the array are numbered from
1
to
2
n
.
You have to process
q
queries to this array. In the
i
-th query, you will be given an integer
k
(
0≤k≤n−1
). To process the query, you should do the following:
for every
i∈[1,
2
n
−
2
k
]
in ascending order, do the following: if the
i
-th element was already swapped with some other element during this query, skip it; otherwise, swap
a
i
and
a
i+
2
k
;
after that, print the maximum sum over all contiguous subsegments of the array (including the empty subsegment).
For example, if the array
a
is
[−3,5,−3,2,8,−20,6,−1]
, and
k=1
, the query is processed as follows:
the
1
-st element wasn't swapped yet, so we swap it with the
3
-rd element;
the
2
-nd element wasn't swapped yet, so we swap it with the
4
-th element;
the
3
-rd element was swapped already;
the
4
-th element was swapped already;
the
5
-th element wasn't swapped yet, so we swap it with the
7
-th element;
the
6
-th element wasn't swapped yet, so we swap it with the
8
-th element.
So, the array becomes
[−3,2,−3,5,6,−1,8,−20]
. The subsegment with the maximum sum is
[5,6,−1,8]
, and the answer to the query is
18
.
Note that the queries actually change the array, i. e. after a query is performed, the array does not return to its original state, and the next query will be applied to the modified array.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤18
).
The second line contains
2
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
2
n
(
−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
The third line contains one integer
q
(
1≤q≤2⋅
10
5
).
Then
q
lines follow, the
i
-th of them contains one integer
k
(
0≤k≤n−1
) describing the
i
-th query.
Output
For each query, print one integer — the maximum sum over all contiguous subsegments of the array (including the empty subsegment) after processing the query.

Transformation of the array in the example:
[−3,5,−3,2,8,−20,6,−1]→[−3,2,−3,5,6,−1,8,−20]→[2,−3,5,−3,−1,6,−20,8]→[5,−3,2,−3,−20,8,−1,6]
