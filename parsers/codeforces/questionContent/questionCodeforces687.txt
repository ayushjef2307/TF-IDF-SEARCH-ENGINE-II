A permutation of length
n
is a sequence of integers from
1
to
n
such that each integer appears in it exactly once.
Let the fixedness of a permutation
p
be the number of fixed points in it — the number of positions
j
such that
p
j
=j
, where
p
j
is the
j
-th element of the permutation
p
.
You are asked to build a sequence of permutations
a
1
,
a
2
,…
, starting from the identity permutation (permutation
a
1
=[1,2,…,n]
). Let's call it a permutation chain. Thus,
a
i
is the
i
-th permutation of length
n
.
For every
i
from
2
onwards, the permutation
a
i
should be obtained from the permutation
a
i−1
by swapping any two elements in it (not necessarily neighboring). The fixedness of the permutation
a
i
should be strictly lower than the fixedness of the permutation
a
i−1
.
Consider some chains for
n=3
:
a
1
=[1,2,3]
,
a
2
=[1,3,2]
 — that is a valid chain of length
2
. From
a
1
to
a
2
, the elements on positions
2
and
3
get swapped, the fixedness decrease from
3
to
1
.
a
1
=[2,1,3]
,
a
2
=[3,1,2]
 — that is not a valid chain. The first permutation should always be
[1,2,3]
for
n=3
.
a
1
=[1,2,3]
,
a
2
=[1,3,2]
,
a
3
=[1,2,3]
 — that is not a valid chain. From
a
2
to
a
3
, the elements on positions
2
and
3
get swapped but the fixedness increase from
1
to
3
.
a
1
=[1,2,3]
,
a
2
=[3,2,1]
,
a
3
=[3,1,2]
 — that is a valid chain of length
3
. From
a
1
to
a
2
, the elements on positions
1
and
3
get swapped, the fixedness decrease from
3
to
1
. From
a
2
to
a
3
, the elements on positions
2
and
3
get swapped, the fixedness decrease from
1
to
0
.
Find the longest permutation chain. If there are multiple longest answers, print any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤99
) — the number of testcases.
The only line of each testcase contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤100
) — the required length of permutations in the chain.
Output
For each testcase, first, print the length of a permutation chain
k
.
Then print
k
permutations
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
k
.
a
1
should be an identity permutation of length
n
(
[1,2,…,n]
). For each
i
from
2
to
k
,
a
i
should be obtained by swapping two elements in
a
i−1
. It should also have a strictly lower fixedness than
a
i−1
.
