Stanley lives in a country that consists of
n
cities (he lives in city
1
). There are bidirectional roads between some of the cities, and you know how long it takes to ride through each of them. Additionally, there is a flight between each pair of cities, the flight between cities
u
and
v
takes
(u−v
)
2
time.
Stanley is quite afraid of flying because of watching "Sully: Miracle on the Hudson" recently, so he can take at most
k
flights. Stanley wants to know the minimum time of a journey to each of the
n
cities from the city
1
.
Input
In the first line of input there are three integers
n
,
m
, and
k
(
2≤n≤
10
5
,
1≤m≤
10
5
,
1≤k≤20
) — the number of cities, the number of roads, and the maximal number of flights Stanley can take.
The following
m
lines describe the roads. Each contains three integers
u
,
v
,
w
(
1≤u,v≤n
,
u≠v
,
1≤w≤
10
9
) — the cities the road connects and the time it takes to ride through. Note that some pairs of cities may be connected by more than one road.
Output
Print
n
integers,
i
-th of which is equal to the minimum time of traveling to city
i
.

Note
In the first sample, it takes no time to get to city 1; to get to city 2 it is possible to use a flight between 1 and 2, which will take 1 unit of time; to city 3 you can get via a road from city 1, which will take 1 unit of time.
In the second sample, it also takes no time to get to city 1. To get to city 2 Stanley should use a flight between 1 and 2, which will take 1 unit of time. To get to city 3 Stanley can ride between cities 1 and 2, which will take 3 units of time, and then use a flight between 2 and 3. To get to city 4 Stanley should use a flight between 1 and 2, then take a ride from 2 to 4, which will take 5 units of time.
