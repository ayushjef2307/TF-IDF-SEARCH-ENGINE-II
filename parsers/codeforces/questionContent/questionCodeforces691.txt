The Narrator has an integer array
a
of length
n
, but he will only tell you the size
n
and
q
statements, each of them being three integers
i,j,x
, which means that
a
i
∣
a
j
=x
, where
|
denotes the bitwise OR operation.
Find the lexicographically smallest array
a
that satisfies all the statements.
An array
a
is lexicographically smaller than an array
b
of the same length if and only if the following holds:
in the first position where
a
and
b
differ, the array
a
has a smaller element than the corresponding element in
b
.
Input
In the first line you are given with two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n≤
10
5
,
0≤q≤2⋅
10
5
).
In the next
q
lines you are given with three integers
i
,
j
, and
x
(
1≤i,j≤n
,
0≤x<
2
30
) — the statements.
It is guaranteed that all
q
statements hold for at least one array.
Output
On a single line print
n
integers
a

,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
<
2
30
) — array
a
.
