An integer template is a string consisting of digits and/or question marks.
A positive (strictly greater than
0
) integer matches the integer template if it is possible to replace every question mark in the template with a digit in such a way that we get the decimal representation of that integer without any leading zeroes.
For example:
42
matches 4?;
1337
matches ????;
1337
matches 1?3?;
1337
matches 1337;
3
does not match ??;
8
does not match ???8;
1337
does not match 1?7.
You are given an integer template consisting of at most
5
characters. Calculate the number of positive (strictly greater than
0
) integers that match it.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing the string
s
(
1≤|s|≤5
) consisting of digits and/or question marks — the integer template for the corresponding test case.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the number of positive (strictly greater than
0
) integers that match the template.
