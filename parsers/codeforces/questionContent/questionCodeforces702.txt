— Spyofgame, founder of Orzlim religion
A long time ago, Spyofgame invented the famous array
a
(
1
-indexed) of length
n
that contains information about the world and life. After that, he decided to convert it into the matrix
b
(
0
-indexed) of size
(n+1)×(n+1)
which contains information about the world, life and beyond.
Spyofgame converted
a
into
b
with the following rules.
bi,0=0
if
0≤i≤n
;
b0,i=ai
if
1≤i≤n
;
bi,j=bi,j−1⊕bi−1,j
if
1≤i,j≤n
.
Here
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Today, archaeologists have discovered the famous matrix
b
. However, many elements of the matrix has been lost. They only know the values of
bi,n
for
1≤i≤n
(note that these are some elements of the last column, not the last row).
The archaeologists want to know what a possible array of
a
is. Can you help them reconstruct any array that could be
a
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅105
).
The second line contains
n
integers
b1,n,b2,n,…,bn,n
(
0≤bi,n<230
).
Output
If some array
a
is consistent with the information, print a line containing
n
integers
a1,a2,…,an
. If there are multiple solutions, output any.
If such an array does not exist, output
−1
instead.

The values of

generated are
[0,2,1]
which is consistent with what the archaeologists have discovered.
