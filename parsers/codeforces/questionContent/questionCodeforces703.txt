You are given a square matrix
A
of size
n×n
whose elements are integers. We will denote the element on the intersection of the
i
-th row and the
j
-th column as
A
i,j
.
You can perform operations on the matrix. In each operation, you can choose an integer
k
, then for each index
i
(
1≤i≤n
), swap
A
i,k
with
A
k,i
. Note that cell
A
k,k
remains unchanged.
For example, for
n=4
and
k=3
, this matrix will be transformed like this:
The operation
k=3
swaps the blue row with the green column.
You can perform this operation any number of times. Find the lexicographically smallest matrix
†
†
you can obtain after performing arbitrary number of operations.

For two matrices
A
and
B
of size
n×n
, let
a
(i−1)⋅n+j
=
A
i,j
and
b
(i−1)⋅n+j
=
B
i,j
. Then, the matrix
A
is lexicographically smaller than the matrix
B
when there exists an index
i
(
1≤i≤
n
2
) such that
a
i
<
b
i
and for all indices
j
such that
1≤j<i
,
a
j
=
b
j
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤1000
) — the size of the matrix.
The
i
-th line of the next
n
lines contains
n
integers
A
i,1
,
A
i,2
,…,
A
i,n
(
1≤
A
i,j
≤
10
9
) — description of the matrix
A
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
2
over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each test case, print
n
lines with
n
integers each — the lexicographically smallest matrix.

Note
Note that in every picture below the matrix is transformed in such a way that the blue rows are swapped with the green columns.
In the first test case, we can perform
1
operation for
k=3
. The matrix will be transformed as below:
In the second test case, we can perform
2
operations for
k=1
and
k=3
:
