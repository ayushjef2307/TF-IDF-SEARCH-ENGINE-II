A

a
of size
n
is called good if for all valid indices
i

Given an integer
n
. Find a permutation
‡

p
of
[0,1,2,…,n−1]
that is good or determine that no such permutation exists.

An integer
x
is said to be a perfect square if there exists an integer
y
such that
x=
y
2
.
‡

An array
b
is a permutation of an array
a
if
b
consists of the elements of
a
in arbitrary order. For example,
[4,2,3,4]
is a permutation of
[3,2,4,4]
while
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation of
[1,2,3]
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of the permutation
p
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output
n
distinct integers
p
0

p
1
,…,
p
n−1
(
0≤
p
i
≤n−1
) — the permutation
p
— if the answer exists, and
−1
otherwise.

Note
In the first test case, we have
n=3
. The array
p=[1,0,2]
is good since
1+0=
1
2
,
0+1=
1
2
, and
2+2=
2
2
In the second test case, we have
n=4
. The array
p=[0,3,2,1]
is good since
0+0=
0
2
,
3+1=
2
2
,
2+2=
2
2
, and
1+3=
