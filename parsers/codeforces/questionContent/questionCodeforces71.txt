Did you think there was going to be a JoJo legend here? But no, that was me, Dio!
Given a binary string
s
of length
n
, consisting of characters 0 and 1. Let's build a square table of size
n×n
, consisting of 0 and 1 characters as follows.
In the first row of the table write the original string
s
. In the second row of the table write cyclic shift of the string
s
by one to the right. In the third row of the table, write the cyclic shift of line
s
by two to the right. And so on. Thus, the row with number
k
will contain a cyclic shift of string
s
by
k
to the right. The rows are numbered from
0
to
n−1
top-to-bottom.
In the resulting table we need to find the rectangle consisting only of ones that has the largest area.
We call a rectangle the set of all cells
(i,j)
in the table, such that
x
1
≤i≤
x
2
and
y
1
≤j≤
y
2
for some integers
0≤
x
1
≤
x
2
<n
and
0≤
y
1
≤
y
2
<n
.
Recall that the cyclic shift of string
s
by
k
to the right is the string
s
n−k+1
…
s
n
s
1
s
2
…
s
n−k
. For example, the cyclic shift of the string "01011" by
0
to the right is the string itself "01011", its cyclic shift by
3
to the right is the string "01101".
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first and the only line of each test case contains a single binary string
s
(
1≤|s|≤2⋅
10
5
), consisting of characters 0 and 1.
It is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths
|s|
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum area of a rectangle consisting only of ones. If there is no such rectangle, output
0
.

Note
In the first test case, there is a table
1×1
consisting of a single character 0, so there are no rectangles consisting of ones, and the answer is
0
.
In the second test case, there is a table
1×1
, consisting of a single character 1, so the answer is
1
.
In the third test case, there is a table:
1 0 1
1 1 0
0 1 1
In the fourth test case, there is a table:
0 1 1 1 1 0
0 0 1 1 1 1
1 0 0 1 1 1
1 1 0 0 1 1
1 1 1 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 0 0
In the fifth test case, there is a table:
1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1 0
0 1 0 1 0 1
Rectangles with maximum area are shown in bold.
