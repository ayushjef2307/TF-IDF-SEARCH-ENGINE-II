Some Number
This version of the problem differs from the next one only in the constraint on
t
. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
You are given two positive integers
l
and
r
.
Count the number of distinct triplets of integers
(i,j,k)
such that
l≤i<j<k≤r
and
lcm(i,j,k)≥i+j+k
.
Here
lcm(i,j,k)
denotes the least common multiple (LCM) of integers
i
,
j
, and
k
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤5
). Description of the test cases follows.
The only line for each test case contains two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤2⋅
10
5
,
l+2≤r
).
Output
For each test case print one integer — the number of suitable triplets.

Note
In the first test case, there are
3
suitable triplets:
(1,2,3)
,
(1,3,4)
,
(2,3,4)
.
In the second test case, there is
1
suitable triplet:
(3,4,5)
.
