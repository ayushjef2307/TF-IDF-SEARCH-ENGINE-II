O_o and Another Young Boy
An array of
n
positive integers
a1,a2,…,an
fell down on you from the skies, along with a positive integer
k≤n
.
You can apply the following operation at most
k
times:
Choose an index
1≤i≤n
and an integer
1≤x≤109
. Then do
ai:=x
(assign
x
to
ai
).
Then build a complete undirected weighted graph with
n
vertices numbered with integers from
1
to
n
, where edge
(l,r)
(
1≤l<r≤n
) has weight
min(al,al+1,…,ar)
.
You have to find the maximum possible diameter of the resulting graph after performing at most
k
operations.
The diameter of a graph is equal to
max
1≤u<v≤n
d(u,v)
, where
d(u,v)
is the length of the shortest path between vertex
u
and vertex
v
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤104
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
2≤n≤105
,
1≤k≤n
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
positive integers
a1,a2,…,an
(
1≤ai≤109
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
105
.
Output
For each test case print one integer — the maximum possible diameter of the graph after performing at most
k
operations.

Note
In the first test case, one of the optimal arrays is
[2,4,5]
.
The graph built on this array:
d(1,2)=d(1,3)=2
and
d(2,3)=4
, so the diameter is equal to
max(2,2,4)=4
.
