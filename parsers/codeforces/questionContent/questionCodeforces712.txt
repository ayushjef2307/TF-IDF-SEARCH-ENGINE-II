An array is sorted if it has no inversions
A Young Boy
You are given an array of
n
positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
.
In one operation you do the following:
Choose any integer
x
.
For all
i
such that
a
i
=x
, do
a
i
:=0
(assign
0
to
a
i
).
Find the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
positive integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.

Note
In the first test case, you can choose
x=3
for the operation, the resulting array is
[0,0,2]
.
In the second test case, you can choose
x=1
for the first operation and
x=3
for the second operation, the resulting array is
[0,0,0,0]
.
