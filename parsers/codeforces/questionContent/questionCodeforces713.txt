You are given a positive integer
n
.
Find any permutation
p
of length
n
such that the sum
lcm(1,
p
1
)+lcm(2,
p
2
)+…+lcm(n,
p
n
)
is as large as possible.
Here
lcm(x,y)
denotes the least common multiple (LCM) of integers
x
and
y
.
A permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order. For example,
[2,3,1,5,4]
is a permutation, but
[1,2,2]
is not a permutation (
2
appears twice in the array) and
[1,3,4]
is also not a permutation (
n=3
but there is
4
in the array).
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤1000
). Description of the test cases follows.
The only line for each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case print
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,
…
,
p
n
 — the permutation with the maximum possible value of
lcm(1,
p
1
)+lcm(2,
p
2
)+…+lcm(n,
p
n
)
.
If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note
For
n=1
, there is only one permutation, so the answer is
[1]
.
For
n=2
, there are two permutations:
[1,2]
 — the sum is
lcm(1,1)+lcm(2,2)=1+2=3
.
[2,1]
 — the sum is
lcm(1,2)+lcm(2,1)=2+2=4
.
