You are given a positive integer
n
. Since
n
may be very large, you are given its binary representation.
You should compute the number of triples
(a,b,c)
with
0≤a,b,c≤n
such that
a⊕b
,
b⊕c
, and
a⊕c
are the sides of a non-degenerate triangle.
Here,
⊕
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
You should output the answer modulo
998244353
.
Three positive values
x
,
y
, and
z
are the sides of a non-degenerate triangle if and only if
x+y>z
,
x+z>y
, and
y+z>x
.
Input
The first and only line contains the binary representation of an integer
n
(
0<n<
2
200000
) without leading zeros.
For example, the string 10 is the binary representation of the number
2
, while the string 1010 represents the number
10
.
Output
Print one integer — the number of triples
(a,b,c)
satisfying the conditions described in the statement modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case,
101
2
=5
.
The triple
(a,b,c)=(0,3,5)
is valid because
(a⊕b,b⊕c,c⊕a)=(3,6,5)
are the sides of a non-degenerate triangle.
The triple
(a,b,c)=(1,2,4)
is valid because
(a⊕b,b⊕c,c⊕a)=(3,6,5)
are the sides of a non-degenerate triangle.
The
6
permutations of each of these two triples are all the valid triples, thus the answer is
12
.
