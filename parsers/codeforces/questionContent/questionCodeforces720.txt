You are the owner of a harvesting field which can be modeled as an infinite line, whose positions are identified by integers.
It will rain for the next
n
days. On the
i
-th day, the rain will be centered at position
x
i
and it will have intensity
p
i
. Due to these rains, some rainfall will accumulate; let
a
j
be the amount of rainfall accumulated at integer position
j
. Initially
a
j
is
0
, and it will increase by
max(0,
p
i
−|
x
i
−j|)
after the
i
-th day's rain.
A flood will hit your field if, at any moment, there is a position
j
with accumulated rainfall
a
j
>m
.
You can use a magical spell to erase exactly one day's rain, i.e., setting
p
i
=0
. For each
i
from
1
to
n
, check whether in case of erasing the
i
-th day's rain there is no flood.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤m≤
10
9
) — the number of rainy days and the maximal accumulated rainfall with no flood occurring.
Then
n
lines follow. The
i
-th of these lines contains two integers
x
i
and
p
i
(
1≤
x
i
,
p
i
≤
10
9
) — the position and intensity of the
i
-th day's rain.
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a binary string
s
length of
n
. The
i
-th character of
s
is 1 if after erasing the
i
-th day's rain there is no flood, while it is 0, if after erasing the
i
-th day's rain the flood still happens.

Note
In the first test case, if we do not use the spell, the accumulated rainfall distribution will be like this:
If we erase the third day's rain, the flood is avoided and the accumulated rainfall distribution looks like this:
In the second test case, since initially the flood will not happen, we can erase any day's rain.
In the third test case, there is no way to avoid the flood.
