A picture can be represented as an
n×m
grid (
n
rows and
m
columns) so that each of the
n⋅m
cells is colored with one color. You have
k
pigments of different colors. You have a limited amount of each pigment, more precisely you can color at most
a
i
cells with the
i
-th pigment.
A picture is considered beautiful if each cell has at least
3
toroidal neighbors with the same color as itself.
Two cells are considered toroidal neighbors if they toroidally share an edge. In other words, for some integers
1≤
x
1
,
x
2
≤n
and
1≤
y
1
,
y
2
≤m
, the cell in the
x
1
-th row and
y
1
-th column is a toroidal neighbor of the cell in the
x
2
-th row and
y
2
-th column if one of following two conditions holds:
x
1
−
x
2
≡±1(modn)
and
y
1
=
y
2
, or
y
1
−
y
2
≡±1(modm)
and
x
1
=
x
2
.
Notice that each cell has exactly
4
toroidal neighbors. For example, if
n=3
and
m=4
, the toroidal neighbors of the cell
(1,2)
(the cell on the first row and second column) are:
(3,2)
,
(2,2)
,
(1,3)
,
(1,1)
. They are shown in gray on the image below:
The gray cells show toroidal neighbors of
(1,2)
.
Is it possible to color all cells with the pigments provided and create a beautiful picture?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
m
, and
k
(
3≤n,m≤
10
9
,
1≤k≤
10
5
) — the number of rows and columns of the picture and the number of pigments.
The next line contains
k
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
k
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) —
a
i
is the maximum number of cells that can be colored with the
i
-th pigment.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
k
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print "Yes" (without quotes) if it is possible to color a beautiful picture. Otherwise, print "No" (without quotes).
