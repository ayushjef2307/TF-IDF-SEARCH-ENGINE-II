You are given three integers
n
,
k
and
f
.
Consider all binary strings (i. e. all strings consisting of characters
0
and/or
1
) of length from
1
to
n
. For every such string
s
, you need to choose an integer
c
s
from
0
to
k
.
A multiset of binary strings of length exactly
n
is considered beautiful if for every binary string
s
with length from
1
to
n
, the number of strings in the multiset such that
s
is their prefix is not exceeding
c
s
.
For example, let
n=2
,
c
0
=3
,
c
00
=1
,
c
01
=2
,
c
1
=1
,
c
10
=2
, and
c
11
=3
. The multiset of strings
{11,01,00,01}
is beautiful, since:
for the string
0
, there are
3
strings in the multiset such that
0
is their prefix, and
3≤
c
0
;
for the string
00
, there is one string in the multiset such that
00
is its prefix, and
1≤
c
00
;
for the string
01
, there are
2
strings in the multiset such that
01
is their prefix, and
2≤
c
01
;
for the string
1
, there is one string in the multiset such that
1
is its prefix, and
1≤
c
1
;
for the string
10
, there are
0
strings in the multiset such that
10
is their prefix, and
0≤
c
10
;
for the string
11
, there is one string in the multiset such that
11
is its prefix, and
1≤
c
11
.
Now, for the problem itself. You have to calculate the number of ways to choose the integer
c
s
for every binary string
s
of length from
1
to
n
in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly
f
.
Input
The only line of input contains three integers
n
,
k
and
f
(
1≤n≤15
;
1≤k,f≤2⋅
10
5
).
Output
Print one integer — the number of ways to choose the integer
c
s
for every binary string
s
of length from
1
to
n
in such a way that the maximum possible size of a beautiful multiset is exactly
f
. Since it can be huge, print it modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first example, the three ways to choose the integers
c
s
are:
c
0
=0
,
c
1
=2
, then the maximum beautiful multiset is
{1,1}
;
c
0
=1
,
c
1
=1
, then the maximum beautiful multiset is
{0,1}
;
c
0
=2
,
c
1
=0
, then the maximum beautiful multiset is
{0,0}
.
