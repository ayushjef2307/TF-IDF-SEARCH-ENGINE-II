You are given three integers
n
,
l
, and
r
. You need to construct an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
l≤
a
i
≤r
) such that
gcd(i,
a
i
)
are all distinct or report there's no solution.
Here
gcd(x,y)
denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers
x
and
y
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line contains three integers
n
,
l
,
r
(
1≤n≤
10
5
,
1≤l≤r≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, if there is no solution, print "NO" (without quotes). You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).
Otherwise, print "YES" (without quotes). In the next line, print
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
 — the array you construct.
If there are multiple solutions, you may output any.

In the first test case,
gcd(1,
