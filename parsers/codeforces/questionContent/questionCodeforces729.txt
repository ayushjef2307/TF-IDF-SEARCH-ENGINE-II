You are given an array
a
consisting of
n
positive integers.
You are allowed to perform this operation any number of times (possibly, zero):
choose an index
i
(
2≤i≤n
), and change
a
i
to
a
i
−
a
i−1
.
Is it possible to make
a
i
=0
for all
2≤i≤n
?
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤100
) — the length of array
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
Output
For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes), if it is possible to change
a
i
to
0
for all
2≤i≤n
, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can print letters in any case (upper or lower).

Note
In the first test case, the initial array is
[5,10]
. You can perform
2
operations to reach the goal:
Choose
i=2
, and the array becomes
[5,5]
.
Choose
i=2
, and the array becomes
[5,0]
.
In the second test case, the initial array is
[1,2,3]
. You can perform
4
operations to reach the goal:
Choose
i=3
, and the array becomes
[1,2,1]
.
Choose
i=2
, and the array becomes
[1,1,1]
.
Choose
i=3
, and the array becomes
[1,1,0]
.
Choose
i=2
, and the array becomes
[1,0,0]
.
In the third test case, you can choose indices in the order
4
