This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference between the versions is the constraints on
n
,
k
,
a
i
, and the sum of
n
over all test cases. You can make hacks only if both versions of the problem are solved.
Note the unusual memory limit.
You are given an array of integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of length
n
, and an integer
k
.
The cost of an array of integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
of length
n
is
max
1≤i≤n
(⌊
a
i
p
i
⌋)−
min
1≤i≤n
(⌊
a
i
p
i
⌋).

Here,
⌊

y
⌋
denotes the integer part of the division of
x
by
y
. Find the minimum cost of an array
p
such that
1≤

i
≤k
for all
1≤i≤n
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n,k≤3000
).
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
1
≤
a
2
≤…≤
a
n
≤3000
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
3000
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible cost of an array
p
satisfying the condition above.

Note
In the first test case, the optimal array is
p=[1,1,1,2,2]
. The resulting array of values of
⌊
a
i
p
i
⌋
is
[4,5,6,4,5]
. The cost of
p
is
max
1≤i≤n
(⌊
a
i
p
i
⌋)−
min
1≤i≤n
(⌊
a
i
p
i
⌋)=6−4=2
. We can show that there is no array (satisfying the condition from the statement) with a smaller cost.
In the second test case, one of the optimal arrays is
p=[12,12,12,12,12]
, which results in all
⌊
a
i
p
i
⌋
being
0
.
In the third test case, the only possible array is
p=[1,1,1]
.
