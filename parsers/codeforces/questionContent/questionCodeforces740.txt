You have a sequence of
n
colored blocks. The color of the
i
-th block is
c
i
, an integer between
1
and
n
.
You will place the blocks down in sequence on an infinite coordinate grid in the following way.
Initially, you place block
1
at
(0,0)
.
For
2≤i≤n
, if the
(i−1)
-th block is placed at position
(x,y)
, then the
i
-th block can be placed at one of positions
(x+1,y)
,
(x−1,y)
,
(x,y+1)
(but not at position
(x,y−1)
), as long no previous block was placed at that position.
A tower is formed by
s
blocks such that they are placed at positions
(x,y),(x,y+1),…,(x,y+s−1)
for some position
(x,y)
and integer
s
. The size of the tower is
s
, the number of blocks in it. A tower of color
r
is a tower such that all blocks in it have the color
r
.
For each color
r
from
1
to
n
, solve the following problem independently:
Find the maximum size of a tower of color
r
that you can form by placing down the blocks according to the rules.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
n
(
1≤
c
i
≤n
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output
n
integers. The
r
-th of them should be the maximum size of an tower of color
r
you can form by following the given rules. If you cannot form any tower of color
r
, the
r
-th integer should be
0
.

Note
In the first test case, one of the possible ways to form a tower of color
1
and size
3
is:
place block
1
at position
(0,0)
;
place block
2
to the right of block
1
, at position
(1,0)
;
place block
3
above block
2
, at position
(1,1)
;
place block
4
to the left of block
3
, at position
(0,1)
;
place block
5
to the left of block
4
, at position
(−1,1)
;
place block
6
above block
5
, at position
(−1,2)
;
place block
7
to the right of block
6
, at position
(0,2)
.
The blocks at positions
(0,0)
,
(0,1)
, and
(0,2)
all have color
1
, forming an tower of size
3
.
In the second test case, note that the following placement is not valid, since you are not allowed to place block
6
under block
5
:
It can be shown that it is impossible to form a tower of color
4
and size
3
.
