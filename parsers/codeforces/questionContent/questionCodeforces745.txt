One night, Mark realized that there is an essay due tomorrow. He hasn't written anything yet, so Mark decided to randomly copy-paste substrings from the prompt to make the essay.
More formally, the prompt is a string
s
of initial length
n
. Mark will perform the copy-pasting operation
c
times. Each operation is described by two integers
l
and
r
, which means that Mark will append letters
s
l
s
l+1
…
s
r
to the end of string
s
. Note that the length of
s
increases after this operation.
Of course, Mark needs to be able to see what has been written. After copying, Mark will ask
q
queries: given an integer
k
, determine the
k
-th letter of the final string
s
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
c
, and
q
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤c≤40
, and
1≤q≤
10
4
) — the length of the initial string
s
, the number of copy-pasting operations, and the number of queries, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains a single string
s
of length
n
. It is guaranteed that
s
only contains lowercase English letters.
The following
c
lines describe the copy-pasting operation. Each line contains two integers
l
and
r
(
1≤l≤r≤
10
18
). It is also guaranteed that
r
does not exceed the current length of
s
.
The last
q
lines of each test case describe the queries. Each line contains a single integer
k
(
1≤k≤
10
18
). It is also guaranteed that
k
does not exceed the final length of
s
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
and
q
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
and
10
4
, respectively.
Output
For each query, print the
k
-th letter of the final string
s
.

Note
In the first test case, the copy-paste process is as follows.
The first step is pasting string
mark
at the end, yielding the string
markmark
.
The second step is pasting string
mar
at the end, yielding the string
markmarkmar
.
The third step is pasting string
rkmark
at the end, yielding the string
markmarkmarrkmark
.
In the second test case, the copy-paste process is as follows.
The first step is pasting string
re
at the end, yielding the string
creamiire
.
The second step is pasting string
ea
at the end, yielding the string
creamiireea
.
The third step is pasting string
reamiire
at the end, yielding the string
