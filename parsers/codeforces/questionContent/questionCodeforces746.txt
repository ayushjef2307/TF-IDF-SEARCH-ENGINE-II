Mark is cleaning a row of
n
rooms. The
i
-th room has a nonnegative dust level
a
i
. He has a magical cleaning machine that can do the following three-step operation.
Select two indices
i<j
such that the dust levels
a
i
,
a
i+1
,
…
,
a
j−1
are all strictly greater than
0
.
Set
a
i
to
a
i
−1
.
Set
a
j
to
a
j
+1
.
Mark's goal is to make
a
1
=
a
2
=…=
a
n−1
=0
so that he can nicely sweep the
n
-th room. Determine the minimum number of operations needed to reach his goal.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of rooms.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
, ...,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the dust level of each room.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a line containing a single integer — the minimum number of operations. It can be proven that there is a sequence of operations that meets the goal.

Note
In the first case, one possible sequence of operations is as follows.
Choose
i=1
and
j=2
, yielding the array
[1,1,0]
.
Choose
i=1
and
j=3
, yielding the array
[0,1,1]
.
Choose
i=2
and
j=3
, yielding the array
[0,0,2]
.
At this point,
a
1
=
a
2
=0
, completing the process.
In the second case, one possible sequence of operations is as follows.
Choose
i=4
and
j=5
, yielding the array
[0,2,0,1,1]
.
Choose
i=2
and
j=3
, yielding the array
[0,1,1,1,1]
.
Choose
i=2
and
j=5
, yielding the array
[0,0,1,1,2]
.
Choose
i=3
and
j=5
, yielding the array
[0,0,0,1,3]
.
Choose
i=4
and
j=5
, yielding the array
[0,0,0,0,4]
.
In the last case, the array already satisfies the condition.
