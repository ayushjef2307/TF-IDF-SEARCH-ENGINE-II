Cirno has a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with
n
nodes and
m
edges. The graph has exactly one node that has no out edges. The
i
-th node has an integer
a
i
on it.
Every second the following happens:
Let
S
be the set of nodes
x
that have
a
x
>0
.
For all
x∈S
,
1
is subtracted from
a
x
, and then for each node
y
, such that there is an edge from
x
to
y
,
1
is added to
a
y
.
Find the first moment of time when all
a
i
become
0
. Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n,m
(
1≤n,m≤1000
) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the integer on vertices.
Each line of the following
m
lines contains two integers
x,y
(
1≤x,y≤n
), represent a directed edge from
x
to
y
. It is guaranteed that the graph is a DAG with no multi-edges, and there is exactly one node that has no out edges.
It is guaranteed that both sum of
n
and sum of
m
over all test cases are less than or equal to
10000
.
Output
For each test case, print an integer in a separate line — the first moment of time when all
a
i
become
0
, modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case:
At time
0
, the values of the nodes are
[1,1,1]
.
At time
1
, the values of the nodes are
[0,1,1]
.
At time
2
, the values of the nodes are
[0,0,1]
.
At time
3
, the values of the nodes are
[0,0,0]
.
So the answer is
3
.
In the second test case:
At time
0
, the values of the nodes are
[1,0,0,0,0]
.
At time
1
, the values of the nodes are
[0,1,0,0,1]
.
At time
2
, the values of the nodes are
[0,0,1,0,0]
.
At time
3
, the values of the nodes are
[0,0,0,1,0]
.
At time
4
, the values of the nodes are
[0,0,0,0,1]
.
At time
5
, the values of the nodes are
[0,0,0,0,0]
.
So the answer is
5
.
In the third test case:
The first moment of time when all
a
i
become
0
is
6⋅998244353+4
.
