Luke likes to eat. There are
n
piles of food aligned in a straight line in front of him. The
i
-th pile contains
a
i
units of food.
Luke will walk from the
1
-st pile towards the
n
-th pile, and he wants to eat every pile of food without walking back. When Luke reaches the
i
-th pile, he can eat that pile if and only if
|v−
a
i
|≤x
, where
x
is a fixed integer, and
v
is Luke's food affinity.
Before Luke starts to walk, he can set
v
to any integer. Also, for each
i
(
1≤i≤n
), Luke can change his food affinity to any integer before he eats the
i
-th pile.
Find the minimum number of changes needed to eat every pile of food.
Note that the initial choice for
v
is not considered as a change.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
For each test case, the first line contains two integers,
n,x
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤x≤
10
9
) — the number of piles, and the maximum difference between the size of a pile and Luke's food affinity, such that Luke can eat the pile.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output an integer on a separate line, which is the minimum number of changes needed.

Note
In the first test case, Luke can set
v
to
5
before he starts to walk. And he can walk straight to eat every piles of food without changing
v
.
In the second test case, Luke can set
v
to
3
before he starts to walk. And he could change
v
to
10
before he eats the second pile. After that, he can walk straight to eat remaining food without changing
v
.
In the fourth test case, Luke can set
v
to
3
before he starts to walk. And he could change
v
to
8
before he eats the sixth pile. After that, he can walk straight to eat remaining food without changing
v
.
In the fifth test case, Luke can set
v
to
4
before he starts to walk. And he could change
v
to
6
before he eats the fourth pile. Then he could change
v
to
12
before he eats the seventh pile. After that, he can walk straight to eat remaining food without changing
v
.
