inputstandard input

You are given an array
a
1
,
a
2
,…
a
n
. Count the number of pairs of indices
1≤i,j≤n
such that
a
i
<i<
a
j
<j
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of pairs of indices satisfying the condition in the statement.
Please note, that the answer for some test cases won't fit into 32-bit integer type, so you should use at least 64-bit integer type in your programming language (like long long for C++).

Note
For the first test cases the pairs are
(i,j)
=
{(2,4),(2,8),(3,8)}
.
The pair
(2,4)
is true because
a
2
=1
,
a
4
=3
and
1<2<3<4
.
The pair
(2,8)
is true because
a
2
=1
,
a
8
=4
and
1<2<4<8
.
The pair
(3,8)
is true because
a
3
=2
,
a
8
=4
and
2<3<4<8
.
