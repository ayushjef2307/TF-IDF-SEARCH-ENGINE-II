You are given a square grid with
n
rows and
n
columns. Each cell contains either
0
or
1
.
In an operation, you can select a cell of the grid and flip it (from
0→1
or
1→0
). Find the minimum number of operations you need to obtain a square that remains the same when rotated

The picture below shows an example of all rotations of a grid.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the size of the grid.
Then
n
lines follow, each with
n
characters
a
i,j
(
0≤

) — the number written in each cell.
Output
For each test case output a single integer  — the minimum number of operations needed to make the square look the same rotated

In the second test case, all rotations of the square are already the same, so we don't need any flips.
