You are given
n
strings
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
n
of length at most
8
.
For each string
s
i
, determine if there exist two strings
s
j
and
s
k
such that
s
i
=
s
j
+
s
k
. That is,
s
i
is the concatenation of
s
j
and
s
k
. Note that
j
can be equal to
k
.
Recall that the concatenation of strings
s
and
t
is
s+t=
s
1
s
2
…
s
p
t
1
t
2
…
t
q
, where
p
and
q
are the lengths of strings
s
and
t
respectively. For example, concatenation of "code" and "forces" is "codeforces".
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the number of strings.
Then
n
lines follow, the
i
-th of which contains non-empty string
s
i
of length at most
8
, consisting of lowercase English letters. Among the given
n
strings, there may be equal (duplicates).
The sum of
n
over all test cases doesn't exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a binary string of length
n
. The
i
-th bit should be
1
if there exist two strings
s
j
and
s
k
where
s
i
=
s
j
+
s
k
, and
0
otherwise. Note that
j
can be equal to
k
.

Note
In the first test case, we have the following:
s
1
=
s
2
+
s
2
, since
abab=ab+ab
. Remember that
j
can be equal to
k
.
s
2
is not the concatenation of any two strings in the list.
s
3
=
s
2
+
s
5
, since
abc=ab+c
.
s
4
is not the concatenation of any two strings in the list.
s
5
is not the concatenation of any two strings in the list.
Since only
s
1
and
s
3
satisfy the conditions, only the first and third bits in the answer should be
1
, so the answer is
10100
.
