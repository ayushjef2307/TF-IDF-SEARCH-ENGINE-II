Luca has a cypher made up of a sequence of
n
wheels, each with a digit
a
i
written on it. On the
i
-th wheel, he made
b
i
moves. Each move is one of two types:
up move (denoted by
U
): it increases the
i
-th digit by
1
. After applying the up move on
9
, it becomes
0
.
down move (denoted by
D
): it decreases the
i
-th digit by
1
. After applying the down move on
0
, it becomes
9
.
Example for
n=4
. The current sequence is 0 0 0 0.
Luca knows the final sequence of wheels and the moves for each wheel. Help him find the original sequence and crack the cypher.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤100
) — the number of wheels.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
i
(
0≤
a
i
≤9
) — the digit shown on the
i
-th wheel after all moves have been performed.
Then
n
lines follow, the
i
-th of which contains the integer
b
i
(
1≤
b
i
≤10
) and
b
i
characters that are either
U
or
D
 — the number of moves performed on the
i
-th wheel, and the moves performed.
U
and
D
represent an up move and a down move respectively.
Output
For each test case, output
n
space-separated digits  — the initial sequence of the cypher.

Note
In the first test case, we can prove that initial sequence was
[2,1,1]
. In that case, the following moves were performed:
On the first wheel:
2
→
D
1
→
D
0
→
D
9
.
On the second wheel:
1
→
U
2
→
D
1

U

→
U
3
.
On the third wheel:
1
→
D
0
→
U

.
The final sequence was
[9,3,1]
, which matches the input.
