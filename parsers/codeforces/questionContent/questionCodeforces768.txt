Let
s
be a string of lowercase Latin letters. Its price is the sum of the indices of letters (an integer between 1 and 26) that are included in it. For example, the price of the string abca is
1+2+3+1=7
.
The string
w
and the integer
p
are given. Remove the minimal number of letters from
w
so that its price becomes less than or equal to
p
and print the resulting string. Note that the resulting string may be empty. You can delete arbitrary letters, they do not have to go in a row. If the price of a given string
w
is less than or equal to
p
, then nothing needs to be deleted and
w
must be output.
Note that when you delete a letter from
w
, the order of the remaining letters is preserved. For example, if you delete the letter e from the string test, you get tst.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases in the test. The following are descriptions of
t
test cases.
Each case consists of two lines.
The first of them is the string
w
, it is non-empty and consists of lowercase Latin letters. Its length does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
The second line contains an integer
p
(
1≤p≤5200000
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of string lengths
w
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
Output exactly
t
rows, the
i
-th of them should contain the answer to the
i
-th set of input data. Print the longest string that is obtained from
w
by deleting letters such that its price is less or equal to
p
. If there are several answers, then output any of them.
Note that the empty string  — is one of the possible answers. In this case, just output an empty string.
