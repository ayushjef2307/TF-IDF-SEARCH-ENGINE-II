Monocarp had a permutation
a
of
n
integers
1
,
2
, ...,
n
(a permutation is an array where each element from
1
to
n
occurs exactly once).
Then Monocarp calculated an array of integers
b
of size
n
, where
b
i
=⌊
i
a
i
⌋
. For example, if the permutation
a
is
[2,1,4,3]
, then the array
b
is equal to
[⌊
1
2
⌋,⌊
2
1
⌋,⌊
3
4
⌋,⌊
4
3
⌋]=[0,2,0,1]
.
Unfortunately, the Monocarp has lost his permutation, so he wants to restore it. Your task is to find a permutation
a
that corresponds to the given array
b
. If there are multiple possible permutations, then print any of them. The tests are constructed in such a way that least one suitable permutation exists.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
5
).
The second line contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
0≤
b
i
≤n
).
Additional constrains on the input:
the sum of
n
over test cases does not exceed
5⋅
10
5
;
there exists at least one permutation
a
that would yield this array
b
.
Output
For each test case, print
n
integers — a permutation
a
that corresponds to the given array
b
. If there are multiple possible permutations, then print any of them.
