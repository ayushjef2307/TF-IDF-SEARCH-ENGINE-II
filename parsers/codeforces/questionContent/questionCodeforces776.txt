Recall that a permutation of length
n
is an array where each element from
1
to
n
occurs exactly once.
For a fixed positive integer
d
, let's define the cost of the permutation
p
of length
n
as the number of indices
i
(1≤i<n)
such that
p
i
⋅d=
p
i+1
.
For example, if
d=3
and
p=[5,2,6,7,1,3,4]
, then the cost of such a permutation is
2
, because
p
2
⋅3=
p
3
and
p
5
⋅3=
p
6
.
Your task is the following one: for a given value
n
, find the permutation of length
n
and the value
d
with maximum possible cost (over all ways to choose the permutation and
d
). If there are multiple answers, then print any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤500
) — the number of test cases.
The single line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
).
The sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print the value
d
in the first line, and
n
integers in the second line — the permutation itself. If there are multiple answers, then print any of them.
