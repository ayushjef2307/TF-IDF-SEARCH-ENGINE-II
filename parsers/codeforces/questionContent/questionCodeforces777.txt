There is a field of size
2×2
. Each cell of this field can either contain grass or be empty. The value
a
i,j
is
1
if the cell
(i,j)
contains grass, or
0
otherwise.
In one move, you can choose one row and one column and cut all the grass in this row and this column. In other words, you choose the row
x
and the column
y
, then you cut the grass in all cells
a
x,i
and all cells
a
i,y
for all
i
from
1
to
2
. After you cut the grass from a cell, it becomes empty (i. e. its value is replaced by
0
).
Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to cut the grass in all non-empty cells of the field (i. e. make all
a
i,j
zeros).
You have to answer
t
independent test cases.
Input
The first line of the input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤16
) — the number of test cases. Then
t
test cases follow.
The test case consists of two lines, each of these lines contains two integers. The
j
-th integer in the
i
-th row is
a
i,j
. If
a
i,j
=0
then the cell
(i,j)
is empty, and if
a
i,j
=1
the cell
(i,j)
contains grass.
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum number of moves required to cut the grass in all non-empty cells of the field (i. e. make all
a
i,j
zeros) in the corresponding test case.
