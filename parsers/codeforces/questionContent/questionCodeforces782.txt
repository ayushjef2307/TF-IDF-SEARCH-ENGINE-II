During a daily walk Alina noticed a long number written on the ground. Now Alina wants to find some positive number of same length without leading zeroes, such that the sum of these two numbers is a palindrome.
Recall that a number is called a palindrome, if it reads the same right to left and left to right. For example, numbers
121,66,98989
are palindromes, and
103,239,1241
are not palindromes.
Alina understands that a valid number always exist. Help her find one!
Input
The first line of input data contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. Next, descriptions of
t
test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤100000
) — the length of the number that is written on the ground.
The second line of contains the positive
n
-digit integer without leading zeroes — the number itself.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the values
n
over all test cases does not exceed
100000
.
Output
For each of
t
test cases print an answer — a positive
n
-digit integer without leading zeros, such that the sum of the input integer and this number is a palindrome.
We can show that at least one number satisfying the constraints exists. If there are multiple solutions, you can output any of them.

Note
In the first test case
99+32=131
is a palindrome. Note that another answer is
12
, because
99+12=111
is also a palindrome.
In the second test case
1023+8646=9669
.
In the third test case
385+604=989
.
