You are given a permutation
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
of integers from
0
to
n−1
. Your task is to find how many permutations
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
are similar to permutation
a
.
Two permutations
a
and
b
of size
n
are considered similar if for all intervals
[l,r]
(
1≤l≤r≤n
), the following condition is satisfied:
MEX([
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r
])=MEX([
b
l
,
b
l+1
,…,
b
r
]),
MEX
(
[
]
)
MEX
(
[
b
b
b
]
)
where the
MEX
of a collection of integers
c
1
,
c
2
,…,
c
k
is defined as the smallest non-negative integer
x
which does not occur in collection
c
. For example,
MEX([1,2,3,4,5])=0
, and
MEX([0,1,2,4,5])=3
.
Since the total number of such permutations can be very large, you will have to print its remainder modulo
10
9
+7
.
In this problem, a permutation of size
n
is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
0
to
n−1
in arbitrary order. For example,
[1,0,2,4,3]
is a permutation, while
[0,1,1]
is not, since
1
appears twice in the array.
[0,1,3]
is also not a permutation, since
n=3
and there is a
3
in the array.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the size of permutation
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
distinct integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
<n
) — the elements of permutation
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer, the number of permutations similar to permutation
a
, taken modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
For the first test case, the only permutations similar to
a=[4,0,3,2,1]
are
[4,0,3,2,1]
and
[4,0,2,3,1]
.
For the second and third test cases, the given permutations are only similar to themselves.
For the fourth test case, there are
4
permutations similar to
a=[1,2,4,0,5,3]
:
[1,2,4,0,5,3]
;
[1,2,5,0,4,3]
;
[1,4,2,0,5,3]
;
[1,5,2,0,4,3]
