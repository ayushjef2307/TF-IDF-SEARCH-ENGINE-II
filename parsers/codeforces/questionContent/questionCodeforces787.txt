You are given two even integers
n
and
m
. Your task is to find any binary matrix
a
with
n
rows and
m
columns where every cell
(i,j)
has exactly two neighbours with a different value than
a
i,j
.
Two cells in the matrix are considered neighbours if and only if they share a side. More formally, the neighbours of cell
(x,y)
are:
(x−1,y)
,
(x,y+1)
,
(x+1,y)
and
(x,y−1)
.
It can be proven that under the given constraints, an answer always exists.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The following lines contain the descriptions of the test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two even integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n,m≤50
) — the height and width of the binary matrix, respectively.
Output
For each test case, print
n
lines, each of which contains
m
numbers, equal to
0
or
1
 — any binary matrix which satisfies the constraints described in the statement.
It can be proven that under the given constraints, an answer always exists.
