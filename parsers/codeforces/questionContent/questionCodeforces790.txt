There is an array
a
of length
n
. You may perform the following operation on it:
Choose two indices
l
and
r
where
1≤l≤r≤n
and
a
l
=
a
r
. Then, reverse the subsegment from the
l
-th to the
r
-th element, i. e. set
[
a
l
,
a
l+1
,…,
a
r−1
,
a
r
]
to
[
a
r
,
a
r−1
,…,
a
l+1
,
a
l
]
.
You are also given another array
b
of length
n
which is a permutation of
a
. Find a sequence of at most
n
2
operations that transforms array
a
into
b
, or report that no such sequence exists.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤500
) — the length of array
a
and
b
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
) — elements of the array
a
.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤n
) — elements of the array
b
.
It is guaranteed that
b
is a permutation of
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
500
.
Output
For each test case, output "NO" (without quotes) if it is impossible to turn
a
into
b
using at most
n
2
operations.
Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then output an integer
k
(
0≤k≤
n
2
) denoting the number of operations you will perform. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.
Afterwards, output
k
lines. The
i
-th line should contain two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
) — the left and right indices for the
i
-th operation.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).
If there are multiple possible sequences of operations, you may output any of them.

It can be proven that it is impossible to turn

into

in the third and fourth test cases.
