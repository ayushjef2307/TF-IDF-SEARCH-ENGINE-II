You are given a permutation
a
of length
n
. Recall that permutation is an array consisting of
n
distinct integers from
1
to
n
in arbitrary order.
You have a strength of
s
and perform
n
moves on the permutation
a
. The
i
-th move consists of the following:
Pick two integers
x
and
y
such that
i≤x≤y≤min(i+s,n)
, and swap the positions of the integers
x
and
y
in the permutation
a
. Note that you can select
x=y
in the operation, in which case no swap will occur.
You want to turn
a
into another permutation
b
after
n
moves. However, some elements of
b
are missing and are replaced with
−1
instead. Count the number of ways to replace each
−1
in
b
with some integer from
1
to
n
so that
b
is a permutation and it is possible to turn
a
into
b
with a strength of
s
.
Since the answer can be large, output it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
s
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;
1≤s≤n
) — the size of the permutation and your strength, respectively.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
) — the elements of
a
. All elements of
a
are distinct.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤n
or
b
i
=−1
) — the elements of
b
. All elements of
b
that are not equal to
−1
are distinct.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of ways to fill up the permutation
b
so that it is possible to turn
a
into
b
using a strength of
s
, modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case,
a=[2,1,3]
. There are two possible ways to fill out the
−1
s in
b
to make it a permutation:
[3,1,2]
or
[3,2,1]
. We can make
a
into
[3,1,2]
with a strength of
1
as follows:
[2,1,3]
−

−

x=1,y=1

It can be proven that it is impossible to make
[2,1,3]
into
[3,2,1]
with a strength of
1
. Thus only one permutation
b
satisfies the constraints, so the answer is
1
.
In the second test case,
a
and
b
the same as the previous test case, but we now have a strength of
2
. We can make
a
into
[3,2,1]
with a strength of
2
as follows:
[2,1,3]
−
→
−
−
−
−
x=1,y=3
[2,3,1]

We can still make
a
into
[3,1,2]
using a strength of
1
as shown in the previous test case, so the answer is
2
.
In the third test case, there is only one permutation
b
. It can be shown that it is impossible to turn
a
into
b
, so the answer is
0
.
