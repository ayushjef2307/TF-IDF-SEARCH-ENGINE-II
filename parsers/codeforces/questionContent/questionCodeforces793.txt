You are given an array
a
of length
n
. The array is called 3SUM-closed if for all distinct indices
i
,
j
,
k
, the sum
a
i
+
a
j
+
a
k
is an element of the array. More formally,
a
is 3SUM-closed if for all integers
1≤i<j<k≤n
, there exists some integer
1≤l≤n
such that
a
i
+
a
j
+
a
k
=
a
l
.
Determine if
a
is 3SUM-closed.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
3≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
across all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if
a
is 3SUM-closed and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
In the first test case, there is only one triple where
i=1
,
j=2
,
k=3
. In this case,
a
1
+
a
2
+
a
3
=0
, which is an element of the array (
a
2
=0
), so the array is 3SUM-closed.
In the second test case,
a
1
+
a
4
+
a
5
=−1
, which is not an element of the array. Therefore, the array is not 3SUM-closed.
In the third test case,
a
i
+
a
j
+
a
k
=0
for all distinct
i
,
j
,
k
, and
0
is an element of the array, so the array is 3SUM-closed.
