You are asked to build an array
a
, consisting of
n
integers, each element should be from
1
to
k
.
The array should be non-decreasing (
a
i
≤
a
i+1
for all
i
from
1
to
n−1
).
You are also given additional constraints on it. Each constraint is of one of three following types:
1 i x
:
a
i
should not be equal to
x
;
2 i j x
:
a
i
+
a
j
should be less than or equal to
x
;
3 i j x
:
a
i
+
a
j
should be greater than or equal to
x
.
Build any non-decreasing array that satisfies all constraints or report that no such array exists.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains three integers
n,m
and
k
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
4
;
0≤m≤2⋅
10
4
;
2≤k≤10
).
The
i
-th of the next
m
lines contains a description of a constraint. Each constraint is of one of three following types:
1 i x
(
1≤i≤n
;
1≤x≤k
):
a
i
should not be equal to
x
;
2 i j x
(
1≤i<j≤n
;
2≤x≤2⋅k
):
a
i
+
a
j
should be less than or equal to
x
;
3 i j x
(
1≤i<j≤n
;
2≤x≤2⋅k
):
a
i
+
a
j
should be greater than or equal to
x
.
The sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
4
. The sum of
m
over all testcases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
4
.
Output
For each testcase, determine if there exists a non-decreasing array that satisfies all conditions. If there is no such array, then print -1. Otherwise, print any valid array —
n
integers from
1
to
k
.
