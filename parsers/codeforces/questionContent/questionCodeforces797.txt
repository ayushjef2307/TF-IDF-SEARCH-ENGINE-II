You are given
n
points on the plane, the coordinates of the
i
-th point are
(
x
i
,
y
i
)
. No two points have the same coordinates.
The distance between points
i
and
j
is defined as
d(i,j)=|
x
i
−
x
j
|+|
y
i
−
y
j
|
.
For each point, you have to choose a color, represented by an integer from
1
to
n
. For every ordered triple of different points
(a,b,c)
, the following constraints should be met:
if
a
,
b
and
c
have the same color, then
d(a,b)=d(a,c)=d(b,c)
;
if
a
and
b
have the same color, and the color of
c
is different from the color of
a
, then
d(a,b)<d(a,c)
and
d(a,b)<d(b,c)
.
Calculate the number of different ways to choose the colors that meet these constraints.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
2≤n≤100
) — the number of points.
Then
n
lines follow. The
i
-th of them contains two integers
x
i
and
y
i
(
0≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤
10
8
).
No two points have the same coordinates (i. e. if
i≠j
, then either
x
i
≠
x
j
or
y
i
≠
y
j
).
Output
Print one integer — the number of ways to choose the colors for the points. Since it can be large, print it modulo
998244353
.
