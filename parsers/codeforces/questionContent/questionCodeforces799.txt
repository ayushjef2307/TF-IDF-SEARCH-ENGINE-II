You are given two strings
s
and
t
, both of length
n
. Each character in both string is 'a', 'b' or 'c'.
In one move, you can perform one of the following actions:
choose an occurrence of "ab" in
s
and replace it with "ba";
choose an occurrence of "bc" in
s
and replace it with "cb".
You are allowed to perform an arbitrary amount of moves (possibly, zero). Can you change string
s
to make it equal to string
t
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
q
(
1≤q≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the length of strings
s
and
t
.
The second line contains string
s
of length
n
. Each character is 'a', 'b' or 'c'.
The third line contains string
t
of length
n
. Each character is 'a', 'b' or 'c'.
The sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each testcase, print "YES" if you can change string
s
to make it equal to string
t
by performing an arbitrary amount of moves (possibly, zero). Otherwise, print "NO".
