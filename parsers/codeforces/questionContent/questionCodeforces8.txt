Ira loves Spanish flamenco dance very much. She decided to start her own dance studio and found
n
students,
i
th of whom has level
a
i
.
Ira can choose several of her students and set a dance with them. So she can set a huge number of dances, but she is only interested in magnificent dances. The dance is called magnificent if the following is true:
exactly
m
students participate in the dance;
levels of all dancers are pairwise distinct;
levels of every two dancers have an absolute difference strictly less than
m
.
For example, if
m=3
and
a=[4,2,2,3,6]
, the following dances are magnificent (students participating in the dance are highlighted in red):
[4,2,2,3,6]
,
[4,2,2,3,6]
. At the same time dances
[4,2,2,3,6]
,
[4,2,2,3,6]
,
[4,2,2,3,6]
are not magnificent.
In the dance
[4,2,2,3,6]
only
2
students participate, although
m=3
.
The dance
[4,2,2,3,6]
involves students with levels
2
and
2
, although levels of all dancers must be pairwise distinct.
In the dance
[4,2,2,3,6]
students with levels
3
and
6
participate, but
|3−6|=3
, although
m=3
.
Help Ira count the number of magnificent dances that she can set. Since this number can be very large, count it modulo
10
9
+7
. Two dances are considered different if the sets of students participating in them are different.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains integers
n
and
m
(
1≤m≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of Ira students and the number of dancers in the magnificent dance.
The second line of each testcase contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — levels of students.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all testcases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each testcase, print a single integer — the number of magnificent dances. Since this number can be very large, print it modulo
10
9
+7
.

In the first testcase, Ira can set such magnificent dances:
[8,10,10,9,6,11,7]
,
