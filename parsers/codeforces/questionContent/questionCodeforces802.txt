You are given a positive integer
k
. For a multiset of integers
S
, define
f(S)
as the following.
If the number of elements in
S
is less than
k
,
f(S)=0
.
Otherwise, define
f(S)
as the maximum product you can get by choosing exactly
k
integers from
S
.
More formally, let
|S|
denote the number of elements in
S
. Then,
If
|S|<k
,
f(S)=0
.
Otherwise,
f(S)=

You are given a multiset of integers,
A
. Compute
∑
B⊆A
f(B)
modulo
10

+7
.
Note that in this problem, we distinguish the elements by indices instead of values. That is, a multiset consisting of
n
elements always has
2
n
distinct subsets regardless of whether some of its elements are equal.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers
n
and
k
, where
n
is the number of elements in
A
(
1≤k≤n≤600
).
The second line of input contains
n
integers

A
(

Note
Consider the first sample. From the definitions we know that
f(∅)=0
f({−1})=0
f({2})=0
f({4})=0
f({−1,2})=−2
f({−1,4})=−4
f({2,4})=8
f({−1,2,4})=8
So we should print
(0+0+0+0−2−4+8+8)mod(
10
9
+7)=10
.
In the second example, note that although the multiset consists of three same values, it still has
8
distinct subsets:
∅,{1},{1},{1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1},{1,1,1}
.
