Suppose you are given a 1-indexed sequence
a
of non-negative integers, whose length is
n
, and two integers
x
,
y
. In consecutive
t
seconds (
t
can be any positive real number), you can do one of the following operations:
Select
1≤i<n
, decrease
a
i
by
x⋅t
, and decrease
a
i+1
by
y⋅t
.
Select
1≤i<n
, decrease
a
i
by
y⋅t
, and decrease
a
i+1
by
x⋅t
.
Define the minimum amount of time (it might be a real number) required to make all elements in the sequence less than or equal to
0
as
f(a)
.
For example, when
x=1
,
y=2
, it takes
3
seconds to deal with the array
[3,1,1,3]
. We can:
In the first
1.5
seconds do the second operation with
i=1
.
In the next
1.5
seconds do the first operation with
i=3
.
We can prove that it's not possible to make all elements less than or equal to
0
in less than
3
seconds, so
f([3,1,1,3])=3
.
Now you are given a 1-indexed sequence
b
of positive integers, whose length is
n
. You are also given positive integers
x
,
y
. Process
q
queries of the following two types:
1 k v: change
b
k
to
v
.
2 l r: print
f([
b
l
,
b
l+1
,…,
b
r
])
.
Input
The first line of input contains two integers
n
and
q
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤q≤2⋅
10
5
).
The second line of input contains two integers
x
and
y
(
1≤x,y≤
10
6
).
The third line of input contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤
10
6
).
This is followed by
q
lines. Each of these
q
lines contains three integers. The first integer
op
is either
1
or
2
.
If it is
1
, it is followed by two integers
k
,
v
(
1≤k≤n
,
1≤v≤
10
6
). It means that you should change
b
k
to
v
.
If it is
2
, it is followed by two integers
l
,
r
(
1≤l<r≤n
). It means that you should print
f([
b
l
,
b
l+1
,…,
b
r
])
.
Output
For each query of type
2
, print one real number — the answer to the query. Your answer is considered correct if its absolute error or relative error does not exceed
10
−9
.

Note
Let's analyse the sample.
In the first query, we are asked to compute
f([3,1,1,4])
. The answer is
3.5
. One optimal sequence of operations is:
In the first
1.5
seconds do the second operation with
i=1
.
In the next
2
seconds do the first operation with
i=3
.
In the third query, we are asked to compute
f([1,1,1])
. The answer is
1
. One optimal sequence of operations is:
In the first
0.5
seconds do the second operation with
i=1
.
In the next
0.5
seconds do the first operation with
i=2
.
