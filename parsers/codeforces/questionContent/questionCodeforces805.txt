We say an infinite sequence
a
0
,
a
1
,
a
2
,…
is non-increasing if and only if for all
i≥0
,
a
i
≥
a
i+1
.
There is an infinite right and down grid. The upper-left cell has coordinates
(0,0)
. Rows are numbered
0
to infinity from top to bottom, columns are numbered from
0
to infinity from left to right.
There is also a non-increasing infinite sequence
a
0
,
a
1
,
a
2
,…
. You are given
a
0
,
a
1
,
…
,
a
n
; for all
i>n
,
a
i
=0
. For every pair of
x
,
y
, the cell with coordinates
(x,y)
(which is located at the intersection of
x
-th row and
y
-th column) is white if
y<
a
x
and black otherwise.
Initially there is one doll named Jina on
(0,0)
. You can do the following operation.
Select one doll on
(x,y)
. Remove it and place a doll on
(x,y+1)
and place a doll on
(x+1,y)
.
Note that multiple dolls can be present at a cell at the same time; in one operation, you remove only one. Your goal is to make all white cells contain
0
dolls.
What's the minimum number of operations needed to achieve the goal? Print the answer modulo

Input
The first line of input contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅

).
The second line of input contains

integers
a

a
1
,…,
a

It is guaranteed that the sequence
a
is non-increasing.

Note
Consider the first example. In the given grid, cells
(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)
are white, and all other cells are black. Let us use triples to describe the grid: triple
(x,y,z)
means that there are
z
dolls placed on cell
(x,y)
. Initially the state of the grid is
(0,0,1)
.
One of the optimal sequence of operations is as follows:
Do the operation with
(0,0)
. Now the state of the grid is
(1,0,1),(0,1,1)
.
Do the operation with
(0,1)
. Now the state of the grid is
(1,0,1),(1,1,1),(0,2,1)
.
Do the operation with
(1,0)
. Now the state of the grid is
(1,1,2),(0,2,1),(2,0,1)
.
Do the operation with
(1,1)
. Now the state of the grid is
(1,1,1),(0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,1),(2,1,1)
.
Do the operation with
(1,1)
. Now the state of the grid is
(0,2,1),(2,0,1),(1,2,2),(2,1,2)
.
Now all white cells contain
0
dolls, so we have achieved the goal with
5
operations.
