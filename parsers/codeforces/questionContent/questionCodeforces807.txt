Fishingprince is playing with an array
[
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
]
. He also has a magic number
m
.
He can do the following two operations on it:
Select
1≤i≤n
such that
a
i
is divisible by
m
(that is, there exists an integer
t
such that
m⋅t=
a
i
). Replace
a
i
with
m
copies of
a
i
m
. The order of the other elements doesn't change. For example, when
m=2
and
a=[2,3]
and
i=1
,
a
changes into
[1,1,3]
.
Select
1≤i≤n−m+1
such that
a
i
=
a
i+1
=⋯=
a
i+m−1
. Replace these
m
elements with a single
m⋅
a
i
. The order of the other elements doesn't change. For example, when
m=2
and
a=[3,2,2,3]
and
i=2
,
a
changes into
[3,4,3]
.
Note that the array length might change during the process. The value of
n
above is defined as the current length of the array (might differ from the
n
in the input).
Fishingprince has another array
[
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
k
]
. Please determine if he can turn
a
into
b
using any number (possibly zero) of operations.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
4
,
2≤m≤
10
9
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
The third line of each test case contains one integer
k
(
1≤k≤5⋅
10
4
).
The fourth line of each test case contains
k
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
k
(
1≤
b
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n+k
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each testcase, print Yes if it is possible to turn
a
into
b
, and No otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note
In the first test case of the sample, we can do the second operation with
i=2
:
[1,2,2,4,2]→[1,4,4,2]
.
In the second testcase of the sample, we can:
do the second operation with
i=2
:
[1,2,2,8,2,2]→[1,4,8,2,2]
.
do the second operation with
i=4
:
[1,4,8,2,2]→[1,4,8,4]
.
do the first operation with
i=3
:
[1,4,8,4]→[1,4,4,4,4]
.
do the second operation with
i=2
:
[1,4,4,4,4]→[1,8,4,4]
.
do the second operation with
i=3
:
[1,8,4,4]→[1,8,8]
.
do the second operation with
i=2
:
[1,8,8]→[1,16]
.
