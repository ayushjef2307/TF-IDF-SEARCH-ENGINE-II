Define the score of some binary string
T
as the absolute difference between the number of zeroes and ones in it. (for example,
T=
010001 contains
4
zeroes and
2
ones, so the score of
T
is
|4−2|=2
).
Define the creepiness of some binary string
S
as the maximum score among all of its prefixes (for example, the creepiness of
S=
01001 is equal to
2
because the score of the prefix
S[1…4]
is
2
and the rest of the prefixes have a score of
2
or less).
Given two integers
a
and
b
, construct a binary string consisting of
a
zeroes and
b
ones with the minimum possible creepiness.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤1000)
 — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(
1≤a,b≤100
)  — the numbers of zeroes and ones correspondingly.
Output
For each test case, print a binary string consisting of
a
zeroes and
b
ones with the minimum possible creepiness. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

Note
In the first test case, the score of
S[1…1]
is
1
, and the score of
S[1…2]
is
0
.
In the second test case, the minimum possible creepiness is
1
and one of the other answers is 101.
In the third test case, the minimum possible creepiness is
3
and one of the other answers is 0001100.
