You're given a multiset of non-negative integers
{
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
}
.
In one step you take two elements
x
and
y
of the multiset, remove them and insert their mean value
x+y
2
back into the multiset.
You repeat the step described above until you are left with only two numbers
A
and
B
. What is the maximum possible value of their absolute difference
|A−B|
?
Since the answer is not an integer number, output it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤100
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
6
) — the size of the multiset.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the elements of the multiset.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer, the answer to the problem modulo
10
9
+7
.
Formally, let
M=
10
9
+7
. It can be shown that the answer can be expressed as an irreducible fraction
p
q
, where
p
and
q
are integers and
q≢0(modM)
. Output the integer equal to
p⋅
q
−1
modM
. In other words, output an integer
x
such that
0≤x<M
and
x⋅q≡p(modM)
.

Note
In the first case, you can't do any operations, so the answer is
|7−3|=4
.
In the second case, one of the optimal sequence of operations:
Substitute
1
and
2
with
1.5
;
Substitute
10
and
11
with
10.5
;
The difference between
1.5
and
10.5
is
9
.
In the third case, the exact answer is
3
2
, and
500000005⋅2≡3(mod
10
9
+7)
.
