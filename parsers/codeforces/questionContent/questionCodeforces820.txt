Let's call an array
a
of
m
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
m
Decinc if
a
can be made increasing by removing a decreasing subsequence (possibly empty) from it.
For example, if
a=[3,2,4,1,5]
, we can remove the decreasing subsequence
[
a
1
,
a
4
]
from
a
and obtain
a=[2,4,5]
, which is increasing.
You are given a permutation
p
of numbers from
1
to
n
. Find the number of pairs of integers
(l,r)
with
1≤l≤r≤n
such that
p[l…r]
(the subarray of
p
from
l
to
r
) is a Decinc array.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
)  — the size of
p
.
The second line contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
, all
p
i
are distinct)  — elements of the permutation.
Output
Output the number of pairs of integers
(l,r)
such that
p[l…r]
(the subarray of
p
from
l
to
r
) is a Decinc array.

Note
In the first sample, all subarrays are Decinc.
In the second sample, all subarrays except
p[1…6]
and
p[2…6]
are Decinc.
