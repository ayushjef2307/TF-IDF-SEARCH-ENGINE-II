You are given a tree
G
with
n
vertices and an integer
k
. The vertices of the tree are numbered from
1
to
n
.
For a vertex
r
and a subset
S
of vertices of
G
, such that
|S|=k
, we define
f(r,S)
as the size of the smallest rooted subtree containing all vertices in
S
when the tree is rooted at
r
. A set of vertices
T
is called a rooted subtree, if all the vertices in
T
are connected, and for each vertex in
T
, all its descendants belong to
T
.
You need to calculate the sum of
f(r,S)
over all possible distinct combinations of vertices
r
and subsets
S
, where
|S|=k
. Formally, compute the following:
∑
r∈V
∑
S⊆V,|S|=k
f(r,S),
∑
∑
f
(
S
)
where
V
is the set of vertices in
G
.

,
1≤k≤n
).
Each of the following
n−1
lines contains two integers
x
and
y
(
1≤x,y≤n
), denoting an edge between vertex
x
and
y
.
It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

Note
The tree in the second example is given below:
We have
21
subsets of size
2
in the given tree. Hence,
S∈{{1,2},{1,3},{1,4},{1,5},{1,6},{1,7},{2,3},{2,4},{2,5},{2,6},{2,7},{3,4},{3,5},{3,6},{3,7},{4,5},{4,6},{4,7},{5,6},{5,7},{6,7}}.

And since we have
7
vertices,
1≤r≤7
. We need to find the sum of
f(r,S)
over all possible pairs of
r
and
S
.
Below we have listed the value of
f(r,S)
for some combinations of
r
and
S
.
r=1
,
S={3,7}
. The value of
f(r,S)
is
5
and the corresponding subtree is
{2,3,4,6,7}
.
r=1
,
S={5,4}
. The value of
f(r,S)
is
7
and the corresponding subtree is
{1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
.
r=1
,
S={4,6}
. The value of
f(r,S)
is
3
and the corresponding subtree is
{4,6,7}
.
