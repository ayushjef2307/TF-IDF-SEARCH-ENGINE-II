You are given an array
a
of
n
integers. You are asked to find out if the inequality
max(
a
i
,
a
i+1
,…,
a
j−1
,
a
j
)≥
a
i
+
a
i+1
+⋯+
a
j−1
+
a
j
(
)
holds for all pairs of indices
(i,j)
, where
1≤i≤j≤n
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
). Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
)  — the size of the array.
The next line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, on a new line output "YES" if the condition is satisfied for the given array, and "NO" otherwise. You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).

Note
In test cases
1
and
2
, the given condition is satisfied for all
(i,j)
pairs.
In test case
3
, the condition isn't satisfied for the pair
(1,2)
as
max(2,3)<2+3
.
