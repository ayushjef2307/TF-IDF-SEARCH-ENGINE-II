Given a sequence
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
, find the minimum number of elements to remove from the sequence such that after the removal, the sum of every
2
consecutive elements is even.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
3≤n≤
10
5
).
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — elements of the sequence.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of elements to remove from the sequence such that the sum of every
2
consecutive elements is even.

Note
In the first test case, after removing
3
, the sequence becomes
[2,4,6,8]
. The pairs of consecutive elements are
{[2,4],[4,6],[6,8]}
. Each consecutive pair has an even sum now. Hence, we only need to remove
1
element to satisfy the condition asked.
In the second test case, each consecutive pair already has an even sum so we need not remove any element.
