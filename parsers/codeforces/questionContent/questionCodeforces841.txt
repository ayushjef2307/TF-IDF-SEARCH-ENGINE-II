inputstandard input

You have a stripe of checkered paper of length
n
. Each cell is either white or black.
What is the minimum number of cells that must be recolored from white to black in order to have a segment of
k
consecutive black cells on the stripe?
If the input data is such that a segment of
k
consecutive black cells already exists, then print 0.
Input
The first line contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
Next, descriptions of
t
test cases follow.
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤k≤n≤2⋅
10
5
). The second line consists of the letters 'W' (white) and 'B' (black). The line length is
n
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of values
n
does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each of
t
test cases print an integer — the minimum number of cells that need to be repainted from white to black in order to have a segment of
k
consecutive black cells.

Note
In the first test case,
s
="BBWBW" and
k=3
. It is enough to recolor
s
3
and get
s
="BBBBW". This string contains a segment of length
k=3
consisting of the letters 'B'.
In the second test case of the example
s
="BBWBW" and
k=5
. It is enough to recolor
s
3
and
s
5
and get
s
="BBBBB". This string contains a segment of length
k=5
consisting of the letters 'B'.
In the third test case of the example
s
="BBWBW" and
k=1
. The string
s
already contains a segment of length
k=1
consisting of the letters 'B'.
