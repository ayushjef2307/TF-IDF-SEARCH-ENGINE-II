Kristina has two arrays
a
and
b
, each containing
n
non-negative integers. She can perform the following operation on array
a
any number of times:
apply a decrement to each non-zero element of the array, that is, replace the value of each element
a
i
such that
a
i
>0
with the value
a
i
−1
(
1≤i≤n
). If
a
i
was
0
, its value does not change.
Determine whether Kristina can get an array
b
from an array
a
in some number of operations (probably zero). In other words, can she make
a
i
=
b
i
after some number of operations for each
1≤i≤n
?
For example, let
n=4
,
a=[3,5,4,1]
and
b=[1,3,2,0]
. In this case, she can apply the operation twice:
after the first application of the operation she gets
a=[2,4,3,0]
;
after the second use of the operation she gets
a=[1,3,2,0]
.
Thus, in two operations, she can get an array
b
from an array
a
.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) —the number of test cases in the test.
The descriptions of the test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤5⋅
10
4
).
The second line of each test case contains exactly
n
non-negative integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
The third line of each test case contains exactly
n
non-negative integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
0≤
b
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
values over all test cases in the test does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output on a separate line:
YES, if by doing some number of operations it is possible to get an array
b
from an array
a
;
NO otherwise.
You can output YES and NO in any case (for example, strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
The first test case is analyzed in the statement.
In the second test case, it is enough to apply the operation to array
a
once.
In the third test case, it is impossible to get array
b
from array
a
.
