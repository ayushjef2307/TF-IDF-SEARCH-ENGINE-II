Kuznecov likes art, poetry, and music. And strings consisting of lowercase English letters.
Recently, Kuznecov has found two strings,
a
and
b
, of lengths
n
and
m
respectively. They consist of lowercase English letters and no character is contained in both strings.
Let another string
c
be initially empty. Kuznecov can do the following two types of operations:
Choose any character from the string
a
, remove it from
a
, and add it to the end of
c
.
Choose any character from the string
b
, remove it from
b
, and add it to the end of
c
.
But, he can not do more than
k
operations of the same type in a row. He must perform operations until either
a
or
b
becomes empty. What is the lexicographically smallest possible value of
c
after he finishes?
A string
x
is lexicographically smaller than a string
y
if and only if one of the following holds:
x
is a prefix of
y
, but
x≠y
;
in the first position where
x
and
y
differ, the string
x
has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in
y
.
Input
There are several test cases in the input data. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. This is followed by the test cases description.
The first line of each test case contains three integers
n
,
m
, and
k
(
1≤n,m,k≤100
) — parameters from the statement.
The second line of each test case contains the string
a
of length
n
.
The third line of each test case contains the string
b
of length
m
.
The strings contain only lowercase English letters. It is guaranteed that no symbol appears in
a
and
b
simultaneously.
Output
In each test case, output a single string
c
 — the answer to the problem.

Note
In the first test case, it is optimal to take two 'a's from the string
a
and add them to the string
c
. Then it is forbidden to take more characters from
a
, hence one character 'b' from the string
b
has to be taken. Following that logic, we end up with
c
being 'aabaabaa' when string
a
is emptied.
In the second test case it is optimal to take as many 'a's from string
a
as possible, then take as many 'b's as possible from string
b
. In the end, we take two 'c's from the string
a
emptying it.
