As she closed the Satori's eye that could read minds, Koishi gained the ability to live in unconsciousness. Even she herself does not know what she is up to.
— Subterranean Animism
Koishi is unconsciously permuting
n
numbers:
1,2,…,n
.
She thinks the permutation
p
is beautiful if
s=
∑
i=1
n−1
[
p
i
+1=
p
i+1
]
.
[x]
equals to
1
if
x
holds, or
0
otherwise.
For each
k∈[0,n−1]
, she wants to know the number of beautiful permutations of length
n
satisfying
k=
∑
i=1
n−1
[
p
i
<
p
i+1
]
.
Input
There is one line containing two intergers
n
(
1≤n≤250000
) and
s
(
0≤s<n
).
Output
Print one line with
n
intergers. The
i
-th integers represents the answer of
k=i−1
, modulo
998244353
.

Note
Let
f(p)=
∑
i=1
n−1
[
p
i
<
p
i+1
]
.
Testcase 1:
[2,1]
is the only beautiful permutation. And
f([2,1])=0
.
Testcase 2:
Beautiful permutations:
[1,2,4,3]
,
[1,3,4,2]
,
[1,4,2,3]
,
[2,1,3,4]
,
[2,3,1,4]
,
[3,1,2,4]
,
[3,4,2,1]
,
[4,2,3,1]
,
[4,3,1,2]
. The first six of them satisfy
f(p)=2
, while others satisfy
f(p)=1
.
