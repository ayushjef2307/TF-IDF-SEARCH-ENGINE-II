—Kijin Seija, Double Dealing Characters
Shinmyoumaru has a mallet that can turn objects bigger or smaller. She is testing it out on a sequence
a
and a number
v
whose initial value is
1
. She wants to make
v=
gcd
i≠j
{
a
i
⋅
a
j
}
by no more than
10
5
operations (
gcd
i≠j
{
a
i
⋅
a
j
}
denotes the
gcd
of all products of two distinct elements of the sequence
a
).
In each operation, she picks a subsequence
b
of
a
, and does one of the followings:
Enlarge:
v=v⋅lcm(b)
Reduce:
v=
v
lcm(b)
Note that she does not need to guarantee that
v
is an integer, that is,
v
does not need to be a multiple of
lcm(b)
when performing Reduce.
Moreover, she wants to guarantee that the total length of
b
chosen over the operations does not exceed
10
6
. Fine a possible operation sequence for her. You don't need to minimize anything.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤
10
5
) — the size of sequence
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,⋯,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
6
) — the sequence
a
.
It can be shown that the answer exists.
Output
The first line contains a non-negative integer
k
(
0≤k≤
10
5
) — the number of operations.
The following
k
lines contains several integers. For each line, the first two integers
f
(
f∈{0,1}
) and
p
(
1≤p≤n
) stand for the option you choose (
0
for Enlarge and
1
for Reduce) and the length of
b
. The other
p
integers of the line
i
1
,
i
2
,…,
i
p
(
1≤
i
1
<
i
2
<…<
i
p
≤n
) represents the indexes of the subsequence. Formally,
b
j
=
a
i
j
.
