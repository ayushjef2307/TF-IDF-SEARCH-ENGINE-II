—Perfect Memento in Strict Sense
Ran Yakumo is a cute girl who loves creating cute Maths problems.
Let
f(x)
be the minimal square number strictly greater than
x
, and
g(x)
be the maximal square number less than or equal to
x
. For example,
f(1)=f(2)=g(4)=g(8)=4
.
A positive integer
x
is cute if
x−g(x)<f(x)−x
. For example,
1,5,11
are cute integers, while
3,8,15
are not.
Ran gives you an array
a
of length
n
. She wants you to find the smallest non-negative integer
k
such that
a
i
+k
is a cute number for any element of
a
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10

) — the length of
a
.
The second line contains
n
intergers

) — the array
a
.
Output
Print a single interger
k
— the answer.

Note
Test case 1:
3
is not cute integer, so
k≠0
.
2,4,9,11
are cute integers, so
k=1
.
