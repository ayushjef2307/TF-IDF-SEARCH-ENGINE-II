Alina has discovered a weird language, which contains only
4
words:
A
,
B
,
AB
,
BA
. It also turned out that there are no spaces in this language: a sentence is written by just concatenating its words into a single string.
Alina has found one such sentence
s
and she is curious: is it possible that it consists of precisely
a
words
A
,
b
words
B
,
c
words
AB
, and
d
words
BA
?
In other words, determine, if it's possible to concatenate these
a+b+c+d
words in some order so that the resulting string is
s
. Each of the
a+b+c+d
words must be used exactly once in the concatenation, but you can choose the order in which they are concatenated.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
5
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains four integers
a
,
b
,
c
,
d
(
0≤a,b,c,d≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of times that words
A
,
B
,
AB
,
BA
respectively must be used in the sentence.
The second line contains the string
s
(
s
consists only of the characters
A
and
B
,
1≤|s|≤2⋅
10
5
,
|s|=a+b+2c+2d
)  — the sentence. Notice that the condition
|s|=a+b+2c+2d
(here
|s|
denotes the length of the string
s
) is equivalent to the fact that
s
is as long as the concatenation of the
a+b+c+d
words.
The sum of the lengths of
s
over all test cases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case output
YES
if it is possible that the sentence
s
consists of precisely
a
words
A
,
b
words
B
,
c
words
AB
, and
d
words
BA
, and
NO
otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.

Note
In the first test case, the sentence
s
is
B
. Clearly, it can't consist of a single word
A
, so the answer is
NO
.
In the second test case, the sentence
s
is
AB
, and it's possible that it consists of a single word
AB
, so the answer is
YES
.
In the third test case, the sentence
s
is
ABAB
, and it's possible that it consists of one word
A
, one word
B
, and one word
BA
, as
A+BA+B=ABAB
.
In the fourth test case, the sentence
s
is
ABAAB
, and it's possible that it consists of one word
A
, one word
AB
, and one word
BA
, as
A+BA+AB=ABAAB
.
In the fifth test case, the sentence
s
is
BAABBABBAA
, and it's possible that it consists of one word
A
, one word
B
, two words
AB
, and two words
BA
, as
BA+AB+B+AB+BA+A=BAABBABBAA
.
