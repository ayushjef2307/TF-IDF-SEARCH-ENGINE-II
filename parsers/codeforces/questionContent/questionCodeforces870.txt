You are given an array
a
of
n
non-negative integers. In one operation you can change any number in the array to any other non-negative integer.
Let's define the cost of the array as
DIFF(a)−MEX(a)
, where
MEX
of a set of non-negative integers is the smallest non-negative integer not present in the set, and
DIFF
is the number of different numbers in the array.
For example,
MEX({1,2,3})=0
,
MEX({0,1,2,4,5})=3
.
You should find the minimal cost of the array
a
if you are allowed to make at most
k
operations.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤
10
5
,
0≤k≤
10
5
) — the length of the array
a
and the number of operations that you are allowed to make.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the elements of the array
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
5
.
Output
For each test case output a single integer — minimal cost that it is possible to get making at most
k
operations.

Note
In the first test case no operations are needed to minimize the value of
DIFF−MEX
.
In the second test case it is possible to replace
5
by
1
. After that the array
a
is
[0,2,4,1]
,
DIFF=4
,
MEX=MEX({0,1,2,4})=3
, so the answer is
1
.
In the third test case one possible array
a
is
[4,13,0,0,13,1,2]
,
DIFF=5
,
MEX=3
.
In the fourth test case one possible array
a
is
[1,2,3,0,0,0]
.
