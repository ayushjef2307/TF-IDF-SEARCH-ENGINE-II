There are
n
traps numbered from
1
to
n
. You will go through them one by one in order. The
i
-th trap deals
a
i
base damage to you.
Instead of going through a trap, you can jump it over. You can jump over no more than
k
traps. If you jump over a trap, it does not deal any damage to you. But there is an additional rule: if you jump over a trap, all next traps damages increase by
1
(this is a bonus damage).
Note that if you jump over a trap, you don't get any damage (neither base damage nor bonus damage). Also, the bonus damage stacks so, for example, if you go through a trap
i
with base damage
a
i
, and you have already jumped over
3
traps, you get
(
a
i
+3)
damage.
You have to find the minimal damage that it is possible to get if you are allowed to jump over no more than
k
traps.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤k≤n
) — the number of traps and the number of jump overs that you are allowed to make.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — base damage values of all traps.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case output a single integer — the minimal total damage that it is possible to get if you are allowed to jump over no more than
k
traps.

Note
In the first test case it is allowed to jump over all traps and take
0
damage.
In the second test case there are
5
ways to jump over some traps:
Do not jump over any trap.
Total damage:
5+10+11+5=31
.
Jump over the
1
-st trap.
Total damage:
0
–
+(10+1)+(11+1)+(5+1)=29
.
Jump over the
2
-nd trap.
Total damage:
5+
0
–
+(11+1)+(5+1)=23
.
Jump over the
3
-rd trap.
Total damage:
5+10+
0
–
+(5+1)=21
.
Jump over the
4
-th trap.
Total damage:
5+10+11+
0
–
=26
.
To get minimal damage it is needed to jump over the
3
-rd trap, so the answer is
21
.
