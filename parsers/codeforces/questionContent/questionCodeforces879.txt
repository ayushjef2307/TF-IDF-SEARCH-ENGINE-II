You are given a permutation
p
of integers from
0
to
n−1
(each of them occurs exactly once). Initially, the permutation is not sorted (that is,
p
i
>
p
i+1
for at least one
1≤i≤n−1
).
The permutation is called
X
-sortable for some non-negative integer
X
if it is possible to sort the permutation by performing the operation below some finite number of times:
Choose two indices
i
and
j
(1≤i<j≤n)
such that
p
i
&
p
j
=X
.
Swap
p
i
and
p
j
.
Here
&
denotes the bitwise AND operation.
Find the maximum value of
X
such that
p
is
X
-sortable. It can be shown that there always exists some value of
X
such that
p
is
X
-sortable.
Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(1≤t≤
10
4
)
 — the number of test cases. Description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
)
 — the length of the permutation.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,...,
p
n
(
0≤
p
i
≤n−1
, all
p
i
are distinct)  — the elements of
p
. It is guaranteed that
p
is not sorted.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case output a single integer — the maximum value of
X
such that
p
is
X
-sortable.

Note
In the first test case, the only
X
for which the permutation is
X
-sortable are
X=0
and
X=2
, maximum of which is
2
.
Sorting using
X=0
:
Swap
p
1
and
p
4
,
p=[2,1,3,0]
.
Swap
p
3
and
p
4
,
p=[2,1,0,3]
.
Swap
p
1
and
p
3
,
p=[0,1,2,3]
.
Sorting using
X=2
:
Swap
p
3
and
p
4
,
p=[0,1,2,3]
.
In the second test case, we must swap
p
1
and
p
2
which is possible only with
X=0
.
