Ian and Mary are frogs living on lattice points of the Cartesian coordinate plane, with Ian living on
(0,0)
and Mary living on
(a,b)
.
Ian would like to visit Mary by jumping around the Cartesian coordinate plane. Every second, he jumps from his current position
(
x
p
,
y
p
)
to another lattice point
(
x
q
,
y
q
)
, such that no lattice point other than
(
x
p
,
y
p
)
and
(
x
q
,
y
q
)
lies on the segment between point
(
x
p
,
y
p
)
and point
(
x
q
,
y
q
)
.
As Ian wants to meet Mary as soon as possible, he wants to jump towards point
(a,b)
using at most
2
jumps. Unfortunately, Ian is not good at maths. Can you help him?
A lattice point is defined as a point with both the
x
-coordinate and
y
-coordinate being integers.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤500
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(
1≤a,b≤
10
9
) — the coordinates of the lattice point where Mary lives.
Output
For each test case, print an integer
n
(
1≤n≤2
) on the first line, denoting the number of jumps Ian uses in order to meet Mary. Note that you do not need to minimize the number of jumps.
On the
i
-th line of the next
n
lines, print two integers
0≤
x
i
,
y
i
≤
10
9
separated by a space, denoting Ian's location
(
x
i
,
y
i
)
after the
i
-th jump.
x
n
=a
,
y
n
=b
must hold.
Ian's initial location and his locations after each of the
n
jumps need not be distinct.
If there are multiple solutions, output any.
