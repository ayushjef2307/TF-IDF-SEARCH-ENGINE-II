You are given two integer numbers,
n
and
x
. You may perform several operations with the integer
x
.
Each operation you perform is the following one: choose any digit
y
that occurs in the decimal representation of
x
at least once, and replace
x
by
x⋅y
.
You want to make the length of decimal representation of
x
(without leading zeroes) equal to
n
. What is the minimum number of operations required to do that?
Input
The only line of the input contains two integers
n
and
x
(
2≤n≤19
;
1≤x<
10
n−1
).
Output
Print one integer — the minimum number of operations required to make the length of decimal representation of
x
(without leading zeroes) equal to
n
, or
−1
if it is impossible.

Note
In the second example, the following sequence of operations achieves the goal:
multiply
x
by
2
, so
x=2⋅2=4
;
multiply
x
by
4
, so
x=4⋅4=16
;
multiply
x
by
6
, so
x=16⋅6=96
;
multiply
x
by
9
, so
x=96⋅9=864
.
