You are given a simple connected undirected graph, consisting of
n
vertices and
m
edges. The vertices are numbered from
1
to
n
.
A vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices such that each edge has at least one of its endpoints in the set.
Let's call a lenient vertex cover such a vertex cover that at most one edge in it has both endpoints in the set.
Find a lenient vertex cover of a graph or report that there is none. If there are multiple answers, then print any of them.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains two integers
n
and
m
(
2≤n≤
10
6
;
n−1≤m≤min(
10
6
,
n⋅(n−1)
2
)
) — the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph.
Each of the next
m
lines contains two integers
v
and
u
(
1≤v,u≤n
;
v≠u
) — the descriptions of the edges.
For each testcase, the graph is connected and doesn't have multiple edges. The sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
10
6
. The sum of
m
over all testcases doesn't exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each testcase, the first line should contain YES if a lenient vertex cover exists, and NO otherwise. If it exists, the second line should contain a binary string
s
of length
n
, where
s
i
=1
means that vertex
i
is in the vertex cover, and
s
i
=0
means that vertex
i
isn't.
If there are multiple answers, then print any of them.

Here are the graphs from the first example. The vertices in the lenient vertex covers are marked red.
