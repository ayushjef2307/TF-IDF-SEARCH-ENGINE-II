You are walking with your dog, and now you are at the promenade. The promenade can be represented as an infinite line. Initially, you are in the point
0
with your dog.
You decided to give some freedom to your dog, so you untied her and let her run for a while. Also, you watched what your dog is doing, so you have some writings about how she ran. During the
i
-th minute, the dog position changed from her previous position by the value
a
i
(it means, that the dog ran for
a
i
meters during the
i
-th minute). If
a
i
is positive, the dog ran
a
i
meters to the right, otherwise (if
a
i
is negative) she ran
a
i
meters to the left.
During some minutes, you were chatting with your friend, so you don't have writings about your dog movement during these minutes. These values
a
i
equal zero.
You want your dog to return to you after the end of the walk, so the destination point of the dog after
n
minutes should be
0
.
Now you are wondering: what is the maximum possible number of different integer points of the line your dog could visit on her way, if you replace every
0
with some integer from
−k
to
k
(and your dog should return to
0
after the walk)? The dog visits an integer point if she runs through that point or reaches in it at the end of any minute. Point
0
is always visited by the dog, since she is initially there.
If the dog cannot return to the point
0
after
n
minutes regardless of the integers you place, print -1.
Input
The first line of the input contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤3000;1≤k≤
10
9
) — the number of minutes and the maximum possible speed of your dog during the minutes without records.
The second line of the input contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
−
10
9
≤
a
i
≤
10
9
), where
a
i
is the number of meters your dog ran during the
i
-th minutes (to the left if
a
i
is negative, to the right otherwise). If
a
i
=0
then this value is unknown and can be replaced with any integer from the range
[−k;k]
.
Output
If the dog cannot return to the point
0
after
n
minutes regardless of the set of integers you place, print -1. Otherwise, print one integer — the maximum number of different integer points your dog could visit if you fill all the unknown values optimally and the dog will return to the point
0
at the end of the walk.
