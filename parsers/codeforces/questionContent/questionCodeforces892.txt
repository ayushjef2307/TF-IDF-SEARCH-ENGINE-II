An array is beautiful if both of the following two conditions meet:
there are at least
l
1
and at most
r
1
elements in the array equal to its minimum;
there are at least
l
2
and at most
r
2
elements in the array equal to its maximum.
For example, the array
[2,3,2,4,4,3,2]
has
3
elements equal to its minimum (
1
-st,
3
-rd and
7
-th) and
2
elements equal to its maximum (
4
-th and
5
-th).
Another example: the array
[42,42,42]
has
3
elements equal to its minimum and
3
elements equal to its maximum.
Your task is to calculate the minimum possible number of elements in a beautiful array.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤5000
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing four integers
l
1
,
r
1
,
l
2
and
r
2
(
1≤
l
1
≤
r
1
≤50
;
1≤
l
2
≤
r
2
≤50
).
Output
For each test case, print one integer — the minimum possible number of elements in a beautiful array.

Note
Optimal arrays in the test cases of the example:
[1,1,1,1]
, it has
4
minimums and
4
maximums;
[4,4,4,4,4]
, it has
5
minimums and
5
maximums;
[1,2,1,2,2,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]
, it has
3
minimums and
10
maximums;
[8,8,8]
, it has
3
minimums and
3
maximums;
[4,6,6]
, it has
1
minimum and
2
maximums;
[3,4,3]
, it has
2
minimums and
1
maximum;
[5,5,5,5,5,5]
, it has
6
minimums and
6
maximums.
