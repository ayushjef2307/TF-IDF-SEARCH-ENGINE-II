Yura is a mathematician, and his cognition of the world is so absolute as if he have been solving formal problems a hundred of trillions of billions of years. This problem is just that!
Consider all non-negative integers from the interval
[0,
10
n
)
. For convenience we complement all numbers with leading zeros in such way that each number from the given interval consists of exactly
n
decimal digits.
You are given a set of pairs
(
u
i
,
v
i
)
, where
u
i
and
v
i
are distinct decimal digits from
0
to
9
.
Consider a number
x
consisting of
n
digits. We will enumerate all digits from left to right and denote them as
d
1
,
d
2
,…,
d
n
. In one operation you can swap digits
d
i
and
d
i+1
if and only if there is a pair
(
u
j
,
v
j
)
in the set such that at least one of the following conditions is satisfied:
d
i
=
u
j
and
d
i+1
=
v
j
,
d
i
=
v
j
and
d
i+1
=
u
j
.
We will call the numbers
x
and
y
, consisting of
n
digits, equivalent if the number
x
can be transformed into the number
y
using some number of operations described above. In particular, every number is considered equivalent to itself.
You are given an integer
n
and a set of
m
pairs of digits
(
u
i
,
v
i
)
. You have to find the maximum integer
k
such that there exists a set of integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
k
(
0≤
x
i
<
10
n
) such that for each
1≤i<j≤k
the number
x
i
is not equivalent to the number
x
j
.
Input
The first line contains an integer
n
(
1≤n≤50000
) — the number of digits in considered numbers.
The second line contains an integer
m
(
0≤m≤45
) — the number of pairs of digits in the set.
Each of the following
m
lines contains two digits
u
i
and
v
i
, separated with a space (
0≤
u
i
<
v
i
≤9
).
It's guaranteed that all described pairs are pairwise distinct.
Output
Print one integer — the maximum value
k
such that there exists a set of integers
x
1
,
x
2
,…,
x
k
(
0≤
x
i
<
10
n
) such that for each
1≤i<j≤k
the number
x
i
is not equivalent to the number
x
j
.
As the answer can be big enough, print the number
k
modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first example we can construct a set that contains all integers from
0
to
9
. It's easy to see that there are no two equivalent numbers in the set.
In the second example there exists a unique pair of equivalent numbers:
01
and
10
. We can construct a set that contains all integers from
0
to
99
despite number
1
.
