One day Masha was walking in the park and found a graph under a tree... Surprised? Did you think that this problem would have some logical and reasoned story? No way! So, the problem...
Masha has an oriented graph which
i
-th vertex contains some positive integer
a
i
. Initially Masha can put a coin at some vertex. In one operation she can move a coin placed in some vertex
u
to any other vertex
v
such that there is an oriented edge
u→v
in the graph. Each time when the coin is placed in some vertex
i
, Masha write down an integer
a
i
in her notebook (in particular, when Masha initially puts a coin at some vertex, she writes an integer written at this vertex in her notebook). Masha wants to make exactly
k−1
operations in such way that the maximum number written in her notebook is as small as possible.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
m
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
0≤m≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤k≤
10
18
) — the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of operation that Masha should make.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
i
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — the numbers written in graph vertices.
Each of the following
m
lines contains two integers
u
and
v
(
1≤u≠v≤n
) — it means that there is an edge
u→v
in the graph.
It's guaranteed that graph doesn't contain loops and multi-edges.
Output
Print one integer — the minimum value of the maximum number that Masha wrote in her notebook during optimal coin movements.
If Masha won't be able to perform
k−1
operations, print
−1
.

Note
Graph described in the first and the second examples is illustrated below.
In the first example Masha can initially put a coin at vertex
1
. After that she can perform three operations:
1→3
,
3→4
and
4→5
. Integers
1,2,3
and
4
will be written in the notepad.
In the second example Masha can initially put a coin at vertex
2
. After that she can perform
99
operations:
2→5
,
5→6
,
6→2
,
2→5
, and so on. Integers
10,4,5,10,4,5,…,10,4,5,10
will be written in the notepad.
In the third example Masha won't be able to perform
4
operations.
