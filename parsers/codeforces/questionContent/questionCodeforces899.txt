This is the hard version of the problem. The only difference between the two versions is that the harder version asks additionally for a minimum number of subsegments.
Tokitsukaze has a binary string
s
of length
n
, consisting only of zeros and ones,
n
is even.
Now Tokitsukaze divides
s
into the minimum number of contiguous subsegments, and for each subsegment, all bits in each subsegment are the same. After that,
s
is considered good if the lengths of all subsegments are even.
For example, if
s
is "11001111", it will be divided into "11", "00" and "1111". Their lengths are
2
,
2
,
4
respectively, which are all even numbers, so "11001111" is good. Another example, if
s
is "1110011000", it will be divided into "111", "00", "11" and "000", and their lengths are
3
,
2
,
2
,
3
. Obviously, "1110011000" is not good.
Tokitsukaze wants to make
s
good by changing the values of some positions in
s
. Specifically, she can perform the operation any number of times: change the value of
s
i
to '0' or '1' (
1≤i≤n
). Can you tell her the minimum number of operations to make
s
good? Meanwhile, she also wants to know the minimum number of subsegments that
s
can be divided into among all solutions with the minimum number of operations.
Input
The first contains a single positive integer
t
(
1≤t≤10000
) — the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of
s
, it is guaranteed that
n
is even.
The second line contains a binary string
s
of length
n
, consisting only of zeros and ones.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line with two integers — the minimum number of operations to make
s
good, and the minimum number of subsegments that
s
can be divided into among all solutions with the minimum number of operations.

Note
In the first test case, one of the ways to make
s
good is the following.
Change
s
3
,
s
6
and
s
7
to '0', after that
s
becomes "1100000000", it can be divided into "11" and "00000000", which lengths are
2
and
8
respectively, the number of subsegments of it is
2
. There are other ways to operate
3
times to make
s
good, such as "1111110000", "1100001100", "1111001100", the number of subsegments of them are
2
,
4
,
4
respectively. It's easy to find that the minimum number of subsegments among all solutions with the minimum number of operations is
2
.
In the second, third and fourth test cases,
s
is good initially, so no operation is required.
