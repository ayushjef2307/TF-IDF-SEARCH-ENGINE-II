Tokitsukaze has a sequence
a
of length
n
. For each operation, she selects two numbers
a
i
and
a
j
(
i≠j
;
1≤i,j≤n
).
If
a
i
=
a
j
, change one of them to
0
.
Otherwise change both of them to
min(
a
i
,
a
j
)
.
Tokitsukaze wants to know the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to
0
. It can be proved that the answer always exists.
Input
The first line contains a single positive integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains a single integer
n
(
2≤n≤100
) — the length of the sequence
a
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
0≤
a
i
≤100
) — the sequence
a
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of operations to change all numbers in the sequence to
0
.

Note
In the first test case, one of the possible ways to change all numbers in the sequence to
0
:
In the
1
-st operation,
a
1
<
a
2
, after the operation,
a
2
=
a
1
=1
. Now the sequence
a
is
[1,1,3]
.
In the
2
-nd operation,
a
1
=
a
2
=1
, after the operation,
a
1
=0
. Now the sequence
a
is
[0,1,3]
.
In the
3
-rd operation,
a
1
<
a
2
, after the operation,
a
2
=0
. Now the sequence
a
is
[0,0,3]
.
In the
4
-th operation,
a
2
<
a
3
, after the operation,
a
3
=0
. Now the sequence
a
is
[0,0,0]
.
So the minimum number of operations is
4
.
