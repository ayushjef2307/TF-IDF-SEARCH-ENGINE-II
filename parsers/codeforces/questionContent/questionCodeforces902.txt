Tokitsukaze has a sequence with length of
n
. She likes gems very much. There are
n
kinds of gems. The gems of the
i
-th kind are on the
i
-th position, and there are
a
i
gems of the same kind on that position. Define
G(l,r)
as the multiset containing all gems on the segment
[l,r]
(inclusive).
A multiset of gems can be represented as
S=[
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
n
]
, which is a non-negative integer sequence of length
n
and means that
S
contains
s
i
gems of the
i
-th kind in the multiset. A multiset
T=[
t
1
,
t
2
,…,
t
n
]
is a multisubset of
S=[
s
1
,
s
2
,…,
s
n
]
if and only if
t
i
≤
s
i
for any
i
satisfying
1≤i≤n
.
Now, given two positive integers
k
and
p
, you need to calculate the result of
∑
l=1
n
∑
r=l
n
∑
[
t
1
,
t
2
,⋯,
t
n
]⊆G(l,r)
((
∑
i=1
n
p
t
i
t
k
i
)(
∑
i=1
n
[
t
i
>0])),
n
n
n
n
where
[
t
i
>0]=1
if
t
i
>0
and
[
t
i
>0]=0
if
t
i
=0
.
Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains three integers
n
,
k
and
p
(
1≤n≤
10
5
;
1≤k≤
10
5
;
2≤p≤998244351
) — the length of the sequence, the numbers
k
and
p
.
The second line contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤998244351
) — the number of gems on the
i
-th position.
Output
Print a single integers — the result modulo
998244353
.
