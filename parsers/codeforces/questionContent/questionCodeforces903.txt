Tokitsukaze has a permutation
p
of length
n
.
Let's call a segment
[l,r]
beautiful if there exist
i
and
j
satisfying
p
i
⋅
p
j
=max{
p
l
,
p
l+1
,…,
p
r
}
, where
l≤i<j≤r
.
Now Tokitsukaze has
q
queries, in the
i
-th query she wants to know how many beautiful subsegments
[x,y]
there are in the segment
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
(i. e.
l
i
≤x≤y≤
r
i
).
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
q
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;
1≤q≤
10
6
) — the length of permutation
p
and the number of queries.
The second line contains
n
distinct integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — the permutation
p
.
Each of the next
q
lines contains two integers
l
i
and
r
i
(
1≤
l
i
≤
r
i
≤n
) — the segment
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
of this query.
Output
For each query, print one integer — the numbers of beautiful subsegments in the segment
[
l
i
,
r
i
]
.
