Tokitsukaze has a permutation
p
. She performed the following operation to
p
exactly
k
times: in one operation, for each
i
from
1
to
n−1
in order, if
p
i
>
p
i+1
, swap
p
i
,
p
i+1
. After exactly
k
times of operations, Tokitsukaze got a new sequence
a
, obviously the sequence
a
is also a permutation.
After that, Tokitsukaze wrote down the value sequence
v
of
a
on paper. Denote the value sequence
v
of the permutation
a
of length
n
as
v
i
=
∑
i−1
j=1
[
a
i
<
a
j
]
, where the value of
[
a
i
<
a
j
]
define as if
a
i
<
a
j
, the value is
1
, otherwise is
0
(in other words,
v
i
is equal to the number of elements greater than
a
i
that are to the left of position
i
). Then Tokitsukaze went out to work.
There are three naughty cats in Tokitsukaze's house. When she came home, she found the paper with the value sequence
v
to be bitten out by the cats, leaving several holes, so that the value of some positions could not be seen clearly. She forgot what the original permutation
p
was. She wants to know how many different permutations
p
there are, so that the value sequence
v
of the new permutation
a
after exactly
k
operations is the same as the
v
written on the paper (not taking into account the unclear positions).
Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo
998244353
.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.
The first line contains two integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤
10
6
;
0≤k≤n−1
) — the length of the permutation and the exactly number of operations.
The second line contains
n
integers
v
1
,
v
2
,…,
v
n
(
−1≤
v
i
≤i−1
) — the value sequence
v
.
v
i
=−1
means the
i
-th position of
v
can't be seen clearly.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the number of different permutations modulo
998244353
.

Note
In the first test case, only permutation
p=[5,4,3,2,1]
satisfies the constraint condition.
In the second test case, there are
6
permutations satisfying the constraint condition, which are:
[3,4,5,2,1]
→
[3,4,2,1,5]
→
[3,2,1,4,5]
[3,5,4,2,1]
→
[3,4,2,1,5]
→
[3,2,1,4,5]
[4,3,5,2,1]
→
[3,4,2,1,5]
→
[3,2,1,4,5]
[4,5,3,2,1]
→
[4,3,2,1,5]
→
[3,2,1,4,5]
[5,3,4,2,1]
→
[3,4,2,1,5]
→
[3,2,1,4,5]
[5,4,3,2,1]
→
[4,3,2,1,5]
→
[3,2,1,4,5]
So after exactly
2
times of swap they will all become
a=[3,2,1,4,5]
, whose value sequence is
v=[0,1,2,0,0]
.
