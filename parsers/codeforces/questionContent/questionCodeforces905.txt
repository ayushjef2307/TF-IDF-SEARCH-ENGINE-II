Tokitsukaze has two colorful tapes. There are
n
distinct colors, numbered
1
through
n
, and each color appears exactly once on each of the two tapes. Denote the color of the
i
-th position of the first tape as
c
a
i
, and the color of the
i
-th position of the second tape as
c
b
i
.
Now Tokitsukaze wants to select each color an integer value from
1
to
n
, distinct for all the colors. After that she will put down the color values in each colored position on the tapes. Denote the number of the
i
-th position of the first tape as
num
a
i
, and the number of the
i
-th position of the second tape as
num
b
i
.
For example, for the above picture, assuming that the color red has value
x
(
1≤x≤n
), it appears at the
1
-st position of the first tape and the
3
-rd position of the second tape, so
num
a
1
=num
b
3
=x
.
Note that each color
i
from
1
to
n
should have a distinct value, and the same color which appears in both tapes has the same value.
After labeling each color, the beauty of the two tapes is calculated as
∑

Please help Tokitsukaze to find the highest possible beauty.
Input
The first contains a single positive integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10

) — the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10

An optimal solution for the first test case is shown in the following figure:
The beauty is
|4−3|+|3−5|+|2−4|+|5−2|+|1−6|+|6−1|=18
