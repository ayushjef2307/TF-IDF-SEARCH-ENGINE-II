Tokitsukaze is arranging a meeting. There are
n
rows and
m
columns of seats in the meeting hall.
There are exactly
n⋅m
students attending the meeting, including several naughty students and several serious students. The students are numerated from
1
to
n⋅m
. The students will enter the meeting hall in order. When the
i
-th student enters the meeting hall, he will sit in the
1
-st column of the
1
-st row, and the students who are already seated will move back one seat. Specifically, the student sitting in the
j
-th (
1≤j≤m−1
) column of the
i
-th row will move to the
(j+1)
-th column of the
i
-th row, and the student sitting in
m
-th column of the
i
-th row will move to the
1
-st column of the
(i+1)
-th row.
For example, there is a meeting hall with
2
rows and
2
columns of seats shown as below:
There will be
4
students entering the meeting hall in order, represented as a binary string "1100", of which '0' represents naughty students and '1' represents serious students. The changes of seats in the meeting hall are as follows:
Denote a row or a column good if and only if there is at least one serious student in this row or column. Please predict the number of good rows and columns just after the
i
-th student enters the meeting hall, for all
i
.
Input
The first contains a single positive integer
t
(
1≤t≤10000
) — the number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains two integers
n
,
m
(
1≤n,m≤
10
6
;
1≤n⋅m≤
10
6
), denoting there are
n
rows and
m
columns of seats in the meeting hall.
The second line contains a binary string
s
of length
n⋅m
, consisting only of zeros and ones. If
s
i
equal to '0' represents the
i
-th student is a naughty student, and
s
i
equal to '1' represents the
i
-th student is a serious student.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n⋅m
over all test cases does not exceed
10
6
.
Output
For each test case, print a single line with
n⋅m
integers — the number of good rows and columns just after the
i
-th student enters the meeting hall.

Note
The first test case is shown in the statement.
After the
1
-st student enters the meeting hall, there are
2
good rows and columns: the
1
-st row and the
1
-st column.
After the
2
-nd student enters the meeting hall, there are
3
good rows and columns: the
1
-st row, the
1
-st column and the
2
-nd column.
After the
3
-rd student enters the meeting hall, the
4
rows and columns are all good.
After the
4
-th student enters the meeting hall, there are
3
good rows and columns: the
2
-nd row, the
1
-st column and the
2
-nd column.
