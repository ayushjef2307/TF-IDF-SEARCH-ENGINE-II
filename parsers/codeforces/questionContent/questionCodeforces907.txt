Tokitsukaze has a permutation
p
of length
n
. Recall that a permutation
p
of length
n
is a sequence
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
consisting of
n
distinct integers, each of which from
1
to
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
).
She wants to know how many different indices tuples
[a,b,c,d]
(
1≤a<b<c<d≤n
) in this permutation satisfy the following two inequalities:
p
a
<
p
c
and
p
b
>
p
d
.
Note that two tuples
[
a
1
,
b
1
,
c
1
,
d
1
]
and
[
a
2
,
b
2
,
c
2
,
d
2
]
are considered to be different if
a
1
≠
a
2
or
b
1
≠
b
2
or
c
1
≠
c
2
or
d
1
≠
d
2
.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines.
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
4≤n≤5000
) — the length of permutation
p
.
The second line contains
n
integers
p
1
,
p
2
,…,
p
n
(
1≤
p
i
≤n
) — the permutation
p
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
5000
.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the number of different
[a,b,c,d]
tuples.

Note
In the first test case, there are
3
different
[a,b,c,d]
tuples.

p

=1
, where
p
1

p

and
p

p
4
satisfies the inequality, so one of
[a,b,c,d]
tuples is
[1,2,3,4]
.
Similarly, other two tuples are
[1,2,3,6]
,
[2,3,5,6]
.
