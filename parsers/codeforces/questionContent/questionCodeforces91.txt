Given two positive integers
n
and
m
. Find the sum of all possible values of
a
1
⨁
a
2
⨁…⨁
a
m
, where
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
m
are non-negative integers such that
a
1
+
a
2
+…+
a
m
=n
.
Note that all possible values
a
1
⨁
a
2
⨁…⨁
a
m
should be counted in the sum exactly once.
As the answer may be too large, output your answer modulo
998244353
.
Here,
⨁
denotes the bitwise XOR operation.
Input
Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers
n
and
m
(
0≤n≤
10
18
,1≤m≤
10
5
) — the sum and the number of integers in the set, respectively.
Output
For each test case, output the sum of all possible values of
a
1
⨁
a
2
⨁…⨁
a
m
among all non-negative integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
m
with
a
1
+
a
2
+…+
a
m
=n
. As the answer may be too large, output your answer modulo
998244353
.

Note
For the first test case, we must have
a
1
=69
, so it's the only possible value of
a
1
, therefore our answer is
69
.
For the second test case,
(
a
1
,
a
2
)
can be
(0,5),(1,4),(2,3),(3,2),(4,1)
or
(5,0)
, in which
a
1
⨁
a
2
are
5,5,1,1,5,5
respectively. So
a
1
⨁
a
2
can be
1
or
5
, therefore our answer is
1+5=6
.
For the third test case,
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
10
must be all
0
, so
a
1
⨁
a
2
⨁…⨁
a
10
=0
. Therefore our answer is
0
.
