You are given a rooted tree consisting of
n
vertices numbered from
1
to
n
. The root is vertex
1
. There is also a string
s
denoting the color of each vertex: if
s
i
=B
, then vertex
i
is black, and if
s
i
=W
, then vertex
i
is white.
A subtree of the tree is called balanced if the number of white vertices equals the number of black vertices. Count the number of balanced subtrees.
A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the root. In this problem, all trees have root
1
.
The tree is specified by an array of parents
a
2
,…,
a
n
containing
n−1
numbers:
a
i
is the parent of the vertex with the number
i
for all
i=2,…,n
. The parent of a vertex
u
is a vertex that is the next vertex on a simple path from
u
to the root.
The subtree of a vertex
u
is the set of all vertices that pass through
u
on a simple path to the root. For example, in the picture below,
7
is in the subtree of
3
because the simple path
7→5→3→1
passes through
3
. Note that a vertex is included in its subtree, and the subtree of the root is the entire tree.
The picture shows the tree for
n=7
,
a=[1,1,2,3,3,5]
, and
s=WBBWWBW
. The subtree at the vertex
3
is balanced.
Input
The first line of input contains an integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤4000
) — the number of vertices in the tree.
The second line of each test case contains
n−1
integers
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
<i
) — the parents of the vertices
2,…,n
.
The third line of each test case contains a string
s
of length
n
consisting of the characters
B
and
W
 — the coloring of the tree.
It is guaranteed that the sum of the values
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the number of balanced subtrees.

Note
The first test case is pictured in the statement. Only the subtrees at vertices
2
and
3
are balanced.
In the second test case, only the subtree at vertex
1
is balanced.
In the third test case, only the subtrees at vertices
1
,
3
,
5
, and
7
are balanced.
