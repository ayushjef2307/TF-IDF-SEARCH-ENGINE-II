Given an array
a
of length
n
and an integer
k
, you are tasked to find any two numbers
l
and
r
(
l≤r
) such that:
For each
x
(l≤x≤r)
,
x
appears in
a
at least
k
times (i.e.
k
or more array elements are equal to
x
).
The value
r−l
is maximized.
If no numbers satisfy the conditions, output -1.
For example, if
a=[11,11,12,13,13,14,14]
and
k=2
, then:
for
l=12
,
r=14
the first condition fails because
12
does not appear at least
k=2
times.
for
l=13
,
r=14
the first condition holds, because
13
occurs at least
k=2
times in
a
and
14
occurs at least
k=2
times in
a
.
for
l=11
,
r=11
the first condition holds, because
11
occurs at least
k=2
times in
a
.
A pair of
l
and
r
for which the first condition holds and
r−l
is maximal is
l=13
,
r=14
.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤1000
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
1≤k≤n
) — the length of the array
a
and the minimum amount of times each number in the range
[l,r]
should appear respectively.
Then a single line follows, containing
n
integers describing the array
a
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case output
2
numbers,
l
and
r
that satisfy the conditions, or "-1" if no numbers satisfy the conditions.
If multiple answers exist, you can output any.
