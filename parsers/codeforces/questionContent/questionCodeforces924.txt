You are given a directed acyclic graph, consisting of
n
vertices and
m
edges. The vertices are numbered from
1
to
n
. There are no multiple edges and self-loops.
Let
in
v
be the number of incoming edges (indegree) and
out
v
be the number of outgoing edges (outdegree) of vertex
v
.
You are asked to remove some edges from the graph. Let the new degrees be
i
n
′
v
and
ou
t
′
v
.
You are only allowed to remove the edges if the following conditions hold for every vertex
v
:
i
n
′
v
<
in
v
or
i
n
′
v
=
in
v
=0
;
ou
t
′
v
<
out
v
or
ou
t
′
v
=
out
v
=0
.
Let's call a set of vertices
S
cute if for each pair of vertices
v
and
u
(
v≠u
) such that
v∈S
and
u∈S
, there exists a path either from
v
to
u
or from
u
to
v
over the non-removed edges.
What is the maximum possible size of a cute set
S
after you remove some edges from the graph and both indegrees and outdegrees of all vertices either decrease or remain equal to
0
?
Input
The first line contains two integers
n
and
m
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
;
0≤m≤2⋅
10
5
) — the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph.
Each of the next
m
lines contains two integers
v
and
u
(
1≤v,u≤n
;
v≠u
) — the description of an edge.
The given edges form a valid directed acyclic graph. There are no multiple edges.
Output
Print a single integer — the maximum possible size of a cute set
S
after you remove some edges from the graph and both indegrees and outdegrees of all vertices either decrease or remain equal to
0
.

Note
In the first example, you can remove edges
(1,2)
and
(2,3)
.
in=[0,1,2]
,
out=[2,1,0]
.
i
n
′
=[0,0,1]
,
ou
t
′
=[1,0,0]
. You can see that for all
v
the conditions hold. The maximum cute set
S
is formed by vertices
1
and
3
. They are still connected directly by an edge, so there is a path between them.
In the second example, there are no edges. Since all
in
v
and
out
v
are equal to
0
, leaving a graph with zero edges is allowed. There are
5
cute sets, each contains a single vertex. Thus, the maximum size is
1
.
In the third example, you can remove edges
(7,1)
,
(2,4)
,
(1,3)
and
(6,2)
. The maximum cute set will be
S={7,3,2}
. You can remove edge
(7,3)
as well, and the answer won't change.
Here is the picture of the graph from the third example:
