The Berland language consists of words having exactly two letters. Moreover, the first letter of a word is different from the second letter. Any combination of two different Berland letters (which, by the way, are the same as the lowercase letters of Latin alphabet) is a correct word in Berland language.
The Berland dictionary contains all words of this language. The words are listed in a way they are usually ordered in dictionaries. Formally, word
a
comes earlier than word
b
in the dictionary if one of the following conditions hold:
the first letter of
a
is less than the first letter of
b
;
the first letters of
a
and
b
are the same, and the second letter of
a
is less than the second letter of
b
.
So, the dictionary looks like that:
Word
1
: ab
Word
2
: ac
...
Word
25
: az
Word
26
: ba
Word
27
: bc
...
Word
649
: zx
Word
650
: zy
