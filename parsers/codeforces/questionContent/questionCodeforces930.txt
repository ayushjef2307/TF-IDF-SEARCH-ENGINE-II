You are given two integers
x
and
y
. You want to choose two strictly positive (greater than zero) integers
a
and
b
, and then apply the following operation to
x
exactly
a
times: replace
x
with
b⋅x
.
You want to find two positive integers
a
and
b
such that
x
becomes equal to
y
after this process. If there are multiple possible pairs, you can choose any of them. If there is no such pair, report it.
For example:
if
x=3
and
y=75
, you may choose
a=2
and
b=5
, so that
x
becomes equal to
3⋅5⋅5=75
;
if
x=100
and
y=100
, you may choose
a=3
and
b=1
, so that
x
becomes equal to
100⋅1⋅1⋅1=100
;
if
x=42
and
y=13
, there is no answer since you cannot decrease
x
with the given operations.
Input
The first line contains one integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of one line containing two integers
x
and
y
(
1≤x,y≤100
).
Output
If it is possible to choose a pair of positive integers
a
and
b
so that
x
becomes
y
after the aforementioned process, print these two integers. The integers you print should be not less than
1
and not greater than
10
9
(it can be shown that if the answer exists, there is a pair of integers
a
and
b
meeting these constraints). If there are multiple such pairs, print any of them.
If it is impossible to choose a pair of integers
a
and
b
so that
x
becomes
y
, print the integer
0
twice.
