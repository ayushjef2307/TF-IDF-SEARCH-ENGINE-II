The symbol
∧
is quite ambiguous, especially when used without context. Sometimes it is used to denote a power (
a∧b=
a
b
) and sometimes it is used to denote the XOR operation (
a∧b=a⊕b
).
You have an ambiguous expression
E=
A
1
∧
A

A
3
∧…∧
A
n
. You can replace each
∧
symbol with either a
Power
operation or a
XOR
operation to get an unambiguous expression
E
′
.
The value of this expression
E
′
is determined according to the following rules:
All
Power
operations are performed before any
XOR
operation. In other words, the
Power
operation takes precedence over
XOR
operation. For example,
4XOR6Power2=4⊕(
6
2
)=4⊕36=32
.
Consecutive powers are calculated from left to right. For example,
2Power3Power4=(
2
3
)
4
=
8
4
=4096
.
You are given an array
B
of length
n
and an integer
k
. The array
A
is given by
A
i
=
2
B
i
and the expression
E
is given by
E=
A

∧

A
n
. You need to find the XOR of the values of all possible unambiguous expressions
E
′
which can be obtained from
E
and has at least
k
∧
symbols used as
XOR
operation. Since the answer can be very large, you need to find it modulo
2
2
20
. Since this number can also be very large, you need to print its binary representation without leading zeroes. If the answer is equal to
0
, print
0
.

A={

and
E=8∧2∧4
.
For the first testcase, there is only one possible valid unambiguous expression
E

=8⊕2⊕4=14=(1110

.
For the second testcase, there are three possible valid unambiguous expressions
E

:
8⊕2⊕4=14

⊕4=64⊕4=68
8⊕

=8⊕16=24
XOR of the values of all of these is
14⊕68⊕24=82=(1010010
)

.
For the third testcase, there are four possible valid unambiguous expressions
E

:
8⊕2⊕4=14

XOR of the values of all of these is
14⊕68⊕24⊕16777216=16777298=(1000000000000000001010010

For the fourth testcase,
