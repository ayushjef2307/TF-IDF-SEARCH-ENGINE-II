You are given a positive integer
n
. Let's call some positive integer
a
without leading zeroes palindromic if it remains the same after reversing the order of its digits. Find the number of distinct ways to express
n
as a sum of positive palindromic integers. Two ways are considered different if the frequency of at least one palindromic integer is different in them. For example,
5=4+1
and
5=3+1+1
are considered different but
5=3+1+1
and
5=1+3+1
are considered the same.
Formally, you need to find the number of distinct multisets of positive palindromic integers the sum of which is equal to
n
.
Since the answer can be quite large, print it modulo
10
9
+7
.
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) denoting the number of testcases.
Each testcase contains a single line of input containing a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤4⋅
10
4
) — the required sum of palindromic integers.
Output
For each testcase, print a single integer denoting the required answer modulo
10
9
+7
.

Note
For the first testcase, there are
7
ways to partition
5
as a sum of positive palindromic integers:
5=1+1+1+1+1
5=1+1+1+2
5=1+2+2
5=1+1+3
5=2+3
5=1+4
5=5
For the second testcase, there are total
77
ways to partition
12
as a sum of positive integers but among them, the partitions
12=2+10
,
12=1+1+10
and
12=12
are not valid partitions of
12
as a sum of positive palindromic integers because
10
and
12
are not palindromic. So, there are
74
ways to partition
12
as a sum of positive palindromic integers.
