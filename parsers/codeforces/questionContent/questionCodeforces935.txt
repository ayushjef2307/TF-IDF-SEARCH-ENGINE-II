Let's call a string
s
perfectly balanced if for all possible triplets
(t,u,v)
such that
t
is a non-empty substring of
s
and
u
and
v
are characters present in
s
, the difference between the frequencies of
u
and
v
in
t
is not more than
1
.
For example, the strings "aba" and "abc" are perfectly balanced but "abb" is not because for the triplet ("bb",'a','b'), the condition is not satisfied.
You are given a string
s
consisting of lowercase English letters only. Your task is to determine whether
s
is perfectly balanced or not.
A string
b
is called a substring of another string
a
if
b
can be obtained by deleting some characters (possibly
0
) from the start and some characters (possibly
0
) from the end of
a
.
Input
The first line of input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤2⋅
10
4
) denoting the number of testcases.
Each of the next
t
lines contain a single string
s
(
1≤|s|≤2⋅
10
5
), consisting of lowercase English letters.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
|s|
over all testcases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print "YES" if
s
is a perfectly balanced string, and "NO" otherwise.
You may print each letter in any case (for example, "YES", "Yes", "yes", "yEs" will all be recognized as positive answer).

Note
Let
f
t
(c)
represent the frequency of character
c
in string
t
.
For the first testcase we have

It can be seen that for any substring
t
of
s
, the difference between
f
t
(a)
and
f
t
(b)
is not more than
1
. Hence the string
s
is perfectly balanced.
For the second testcase we have

It can be seen that for the substring
t=bb
, the difference between
f
t
(a)
and
f
t
(b)
is
2
which is greater than
1
. Hence the string
s
is not perfectly balanced.
For the third testcase we have

It can be seen that for any substring
t
of
s
and any two characters
u,v∈{a,b,c}
, the difference between
f
t
(u)
and
f
t
(v)
is not more than
1
. Hence the string
s
is perfectly balanced.
