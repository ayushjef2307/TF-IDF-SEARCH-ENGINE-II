oolimry has an array
a
of length
n
which he really likes. Today, you have changed his array to
b
, a permutation of
a
, to make him sad.
Because oolimry is only a duck, he can only perform the following operation to restore his array:
Choose two integers
i,j
such that
1≤i,j≤n
.
Swap
b
i
and
b
j
.
The sadness of the array
b
is the minimum number of operations needed to transform
b
into
a
.
Given the arrays
a
and
b
, where
b
is a permutation of
a
, determine if
b
has the maximum sadness over all permutations of
a
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
)  — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
)  — the length of the array.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤n
)  — the elements of the array
a
.
The third line of each test case contains
n
integers
b
1
,
b
2
,…,
b
n
(
1≤
b
i
≤n
)  — the elements of the array
b
.
It is guaranteed that
b
is a permutation of
a
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print "AC" (without quotes) if
b
has the maximum sadness over all permutations of
a
, and "WA" (without quotes) otherwise.

Note
In the first test case, the array
[1,2]
has sadness
1
. We can transform
[1,2]
into
[2,1]
using one operation with
(i,j)=(1,2)
.
In the second test case, the array
[3,3,2,1]
has sadness
2
. We can transform
[3,3,2,1]
into
[1,2,3,3]
with two operations with
(i,j)=(1,4)
and
(i,j)=(2,3)
respectively.
In the third test case, the array
[2,1]
has sadness
0
.
In the fourth test case, the array
[3,2,3,1]
has sadness
1
.
