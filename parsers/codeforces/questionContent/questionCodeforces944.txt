You are given an array
a
of length
n
. We define the equality of the array as the number of indices
1≤i≤n−1
such that
a
i
=
a
i+1
. We are allowed to do the following operation:
Select two integers
i
and
x
such that
1≤i≤n−1
and
1≤x≤
10
9
. Then, set
a
i
and
a
i+1
to be equal to
x
.
Find the minimum number of operations needed such that the equality of the array is less than or equal to
1
.
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer
n
(
2≤n≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of array
a
.
The second line of each test case contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤
10
9
) — elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
Output
For each test case, print the minimum number of operations needed.

Note
In the first test case, we can select
i=2
and
x=2
to form
[1,2,2,1,1]
. Then, we can select
i=3
and
x=3
to form
[1,2,3,3,1]
.
In the second test case, we can select
i=3
and
x=100
to form
[2,1,100,100,2]
.
