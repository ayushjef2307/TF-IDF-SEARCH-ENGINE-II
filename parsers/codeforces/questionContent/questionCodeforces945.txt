Let's call a string good if its length is at least
2
and all of its characters are
A
except for the last character which is
B
. The good strings are
AB,AAB,AAAB,…
. Note that
B
is not a good string.
You are given an initially empty string
s
1
.
You can perform the following operation any number of times:
Choose any position of
s
1
and insert some good string in that position.
Given a string
s
2
, can we turn
s
1
into
s
2
after some number of operations?
Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single string
s
2
(
1≤|
s
2
|≤2⋅
10
5
).
It is guaranteed that
s
2
consists of only the characters
A
and
B
.
It is guaranteed that the sum of
|
s
2
|
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, print "YES" (without quotes) if we can turn
s
1
into
s
2
after some number of operations, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.
You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes" and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

Note
In the first test case, we transform
s
1
as such:
∅→AAB→AABAB
.
In the third test case, we transform
s
1
as such:
∅→AAAAAAAAB
.
In the second and fourth test case, it can be shown that it is impossible to turn
s
1
into
s
2
.
