You are given a sequence of
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
. You are also given
x
integers
1,2,…,x
.
You are asked to insert each of the extra integers into the sequence
a
. Each integer can be inserted at the beginning of the sequence, at the end of the sequence, or between any elements of the sequence.
The score of the resulting sequence
a
′
is the sum of absolute differences of adjacent elements in it
(
∑
i=1
n+x−1
|
a
′
i
−
a

i+1
|)
.
What is the smallest possible score of the resulting sequence
a
′
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤
10
4
) — the number of testcases.
The first line of each testcase contains two integers
n
and
x
(
1≤n,x≤2⋅
10
5
) — the length of the sequence and the number of extra integers.
The second line of each testcase contains
n
integers
a
1
,
a
2
,…,
a
n
(
1≤
a
i
≤2⋅
10
5
).
The sum of
n
over all testcases doesn't exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each testcase, print a single integer — the smallest sum of absolute differences of adjacent elements of the sequence after you insert the extra integers into it.
