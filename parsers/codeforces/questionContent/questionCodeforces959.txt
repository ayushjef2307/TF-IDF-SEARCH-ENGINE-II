Let
AND
denote the bitwise AND operation, and
OR
denote the bitwise OR operation.
You are given an array
a
of length
n
and a non-negative integer
k
. You can perform at most
k
operations on the array of the following type:
Select an index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and replace
a
i
with
a
i
OR
2
j
where
j
is any integer between
0
and
30
inclusive. In other words, in an operation you can choose an index
i
(
1≤i≤n
) and set the
j
-th bit of
a
i
to
1
(
0≤j≤30
).
Output the maximum possible value of
a
1
AND
a
2
AND
…
AND
a
n
after performing at most
k
operations.
Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains the integers
n
and
k
(
1≤n≤2⋅
10
5
,
0≤k≤
10
9
).
Then a single line follows, containing
n
integers describing the arrays
a
(
0≤
a
i
<
2
31
).
It is guaranteed that the sum of
n
over all test cases does not exceed
2⋅
10
5
.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the maximum possible
AND
value of
a
1
AND
a
2
AND
…
AND
a
n
after performing at most
k
operations.

Note
For the first test case, we can set the bit
1
(
2
1
) of the last
2
elements using the
2
operations, thus obtaining the array [
2
,
3
,
3
], which has
AND
value equal to
2
.
For the second test case, we can't perform any operations so the answer is just the
AND
of the whole array which is
4
.
