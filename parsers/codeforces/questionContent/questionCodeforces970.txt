Consider every tree (connected undirected acyclic graph) with
n
vertices (
n
is odd, vertices numbered from
1
to
n
), and for each
2≤i≤n
the
i
-th vertex is adjacent to exactly one vertex with a smaller index.
For each
i
(
1≤i≤n
) calculate the number of trees for which the
i
-th vertex will be the centroid. The answer can be huge, output it modulo
998244353
.
A vertex is called a centroid if its removal splits the tree into subtrees with at most
(n−1)/2
vertices each.
Input
The first line contains an odd integer
n
(
3≤n<2⋅
10
5
,
n
is odd) — the number of the vertices in the tree.
Output
Print
n
integers in a single line, the
i
-th integer is the answer for the
i
-th vertex (modulo
998244353
).

Note
Example
1
: there are two possible trees: with edges
(1−2)
, and
(1−3)
— here the centroid is
1
; and with edges
(1−2)
, and
(2−3)
— here the centroid is
2
. So the answer is
1,1,0
.
Example
2
: there are
24
possible trees, for example with edges
(1−2)
,
(2−3)
,
(3−4)
, and
(4−5)
. Here the centroid is
3
.
