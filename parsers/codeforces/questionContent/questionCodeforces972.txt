You are given a board with
n
rows and
n
columns, numbered from
1
to
n
. The intersection of the
a
-th row and
b
-th column is denoted by
(a,b)
.
A half-queen attacks cells in the same row, same column, and on one diagonal. More formally, a half-queen on
(a,b)
attacks the cell
(c,d)
if
a=c
or
b=d
or
a−b=c−d
.
The blue cells are under attack.
What is the minimum number of half-queens that can be placed on that board so as to ensure that each square is attacked by at least one half-queen?
Construct an optimal solution.
Input
The first line contains a single integer
n
(
1≤n≤
10
5
) — the size of the board.
Output
In the first line print a single integer
k
— the minimum number of half-queens.
In each of the next
k
lines print two integers
a
i
,
b
i
(
1≤
a
i
,
b
i
≤n
) — the position of the
i
-th half-queen.
If there are multiple solutions, print any.

Note
Example
1
: one half-queen is enough. Note: a half-queen on
(1,1)
attacks
(1,1)
.
Example
2
: one half-queen is enough too.
(1,2)
or
(2,1)
would be wrong solutions, because a half-queen on
(1,2)
does not attack the cell
(2,1)
and vice versa.
(2,2)
is also a valid solution.
Example
3
: it is impossible to cover the board with one half queen. There are multiple solutions for
2
half-queens; you can print any of them.
