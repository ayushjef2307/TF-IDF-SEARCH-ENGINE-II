A map is a matrix consisting of symbols from the set of 'U', 'L', 'D', and 'R'.
A map graph of a map matrix
a
is a directed graph with
n⋅m
vertices numbered as
(i,j)
(
1≤i≤n;1≤j≤m
), where
n
is the number of rows in the matrix,
m
is the number of columns in the matrix. The graph has
n⋅m
directed edges

An admissible map is a map such that its map graph is valid and consists of a set of cycles.
A description of a map
a
is a concatenation of all rows of the map — a string

You are given a string
s
. Your task is to find how many substrings of this string can constitute a description of some admissible map.
A substring of a string
s

l
of length
l
is defined by a pair of indices
p
and
q
(
1≤p≤q≤l
) and is equal to

q
. Two substrings of
s
are considered different when the pair of their indices
(p,q)
differs, even if they represent the same resulting string.
Input
In the only input line, there is a string
s
, consisting of at least one and at most
20000
symbols 'U', 'L', 'D', or 'R'.
Output
Output one integer — the number of substrings of
s
that constitute a description of some admissible map.

Note
In the first example, there are two substrings that can constitute a description of an admissible map — "RDUL" as a matrix of size
2×2
(pic. 1) and "DU" as a matrix of size
2×1
(pic. 2).
In the second example, no substring can constitute a description of an admissible map. E. g. if we try to look at the string "RDRU" as a matrix of size
2×2
, we can find out that the resulting graph is not a set of cycles (pic. 3).
In the third example, three substrings "RL", two substrings "RLRL" and one substring "RLRLRL" can constitute an admissible map, some of them in multiple ways. E. g. here are two illustrations of substring "RLRLRL" as matrices of size
3×2
(pic. 4) and
1×6
(pic. 5).
