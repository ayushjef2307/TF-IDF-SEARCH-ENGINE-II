A robot is placed in a cell
(0,0)
of an infinite grid. This robot has adjustable length legs. Initially, its legs have length
1
.
Let the robot currently be in the cell
(x,y)
and have legs of length
m
. In one move, it can perform one of the following three actions:
jump into the cell
(x+m,y)
;
jump into the cell
(x,y+m)
;
increase the length of the legs by
1
, i. e. set it to
m+1
.
What's the smallest number of moves robot has to make to reach a cell
(a,b)
?
Input
The first line contains a single integer
t
(
1≤t≤100
) — the number of test cases.
The only line of each test case contains two integers
a
and
b
(
1≤a,b≤
10
9
) — the ending cell.
Output
For each test case, print a single integer — the smallest number of moves the robot is required to make to reach a cell
(a,b)
from a cell
(0,0)
.

Note
In the first testcase, the robot can first jump to
(0,1)
, then to
(1,1)
. If it ever increases the length of its legs, it will only be able to jump past
(1,1)
.
In the second testcase, the robot can jump to
(1,0)
, then increase the length of its length to
2
and jump three times to reach
(1,6)
.
In the third testcase, the robot can increase the length of its legs three times to make it
4
. Then jump to
(0,4)
. Then jump twice to reach
(8,4)
.
