Write a program that is compilable simultaneously in two languages: C++ (GCC 10.3.1, -std=c++11) and FreePascal (3.0.4).
It absolutely does not matter what this program does, the only requirement is that it successfully compiles into an executable file in both C++ and Pascal.
Please use the language Text to submit your solution. Just choose Text as a language in the submission form.
The submitted file can't exceed 2048 bytes. It should compile fast on both compilers.
